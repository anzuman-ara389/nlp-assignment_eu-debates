As you know, with the State of the Union, it is not only the speech to be delivered, but there is a letter of intent that I have put forward and there are a limited number also of additional initiatives. Let me address some of them that have been mentioned here. My first point is on the topic of the rule of law. The rule of law is the glue of our Union. And we’ve brought forward the historic NextGenerationEU package because we knew it was of paramount importance that we had to invest in the European Union. This is common European Union taxpayers’ money and, therefore, there is a strong obligation that we connect it with necessary reforms in the respective Member States. And if in Member States there are issues of the rule of law, we’ve connected it to the investment of NextGenerationEU. And it is absolutely not acceptable that a Member State wants to access the funds of NextGenerationEU without having the reforms that we have agreed upon when closing the contract for NextGenerationEU. So if you want to have taxpayers’ money as investment in your Member State, you have to abide by the rule of law and you have to do the reforms that are necessary. (Applause) Second point, on our defence capabilities. First of all, let me step one step backwards, looking at Ukraine. We all know we want peace in Ukraine, but it has to be a just peace and a lasting one. And for that, Ukraine needs security guarantees. Kyiv must be able, and have the capabilities, to deter a new Russian attack. And here Europe comes into play by ensuring Ukraine’s long-term security, which has strong implications for our defence industry. Europe’s defence industry is running at maximum speed – we know this – but it is not enough, because to empower Ukraine’s deterrence, we must step up the production of our military capabilities. And this is what we are doing with ASAP, for example, the Act in Support of Ammunition Production. And I would like to thank the European Parliament and the Council for passing it in record time. We must also look beyond this ammunition topic, to air defence, maritime, space and cyber, for example. And these capabilities are European by nature. No single Member State can alone develop them, so they require European cooperation, not only on research and development, but also on the industrial front. And this is why we will work on a European defence industry strategy to look into how we can support our industry and ramp up the production of critical equipment, of course in synergy with NATO – this is absolutely paramount. No industrial bottlenecks should prevent us from protecting Europe and giving our full support to Ukraine. And my third point I wanted to address – because it was mentioned by many of you – is the European Green Deal. Politics is always also personal. During this mandate, since 2019, I was blessed in my family to have three grandchildren. I was not a grandmother before that. And since my mandate, the experience of welcoming three little babies to this world changes also the deep conviction that you have for the future of these children. Because my perspective is a very limited one, but if I look at these children or babies, toddlers that they are, in 2030 they will be of school age. In 2050 perhaps they want to have a family and children. And now I, of course, over and over ask myself and you do the same: will they have a spring, a summer, a fall and a winter like we had when we were children? How will their future be? Will they be able to have their own family? How will the world be? And I know this is definitely linked also to how we will decide today about the European Green Deal. So what I can only say here in front of you, honourable Members, is that I am deeply, personally committed to the European Green Deal. I know it is paramount for our survival, but it is also paramount for our future prosperity – if we make it, and we can make it together if we stand united. (Applause)', ' Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr\xa0President, 75 years ago, the guns of the Second World War in Europe fell silent. The Nazi regime was defeated, but Europe lay in ruins. Just five years later, on 9\xa0May\xa01950, Robert Schuman made a declaration that would profoundly change this continent and would put it on a path that no one could have anticipated. For me, this is a very special moment. Seventy years ago, Robert Schuman started a journey, step by step. He showed us the way and the direction. And today, here we are. Just seven days ago, at the EU—Western Balkans Summit, we laid the ground for reuniting the Western Balkans with our union, reuniting Europe’s history with its geography. Yes, today, our union faces its greatest challenge yet: a pandemic that knows no borders, a pandemic that threatens our lives and our way of life, a pandemic that has tested our union to its core. But, as so often in history, this crisis has also shown Europe’s greatest strengths: our commitment to unity, born of common values and shared history, and our solidarity with those in need. Schuman’s words resonate today more strongly than ever before: ‘it is no longer a time for vain words, but for a bold, constructive act’. The Schuman Declaration embodied the perfect balance, the delicate dance between idealism and pragmatism, without which there would be no European Union and no European solidarity as we know it today. He famously said, ‘Europe will not be made all at once according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de\xa0facto solidarity.’ This crisis has put that solidarity to the hardest of tests. In March, some even said that we would not pass these tests. But, if you look around the world today, Europe has become the beating heart of solidarity: French patients treated in German hospitals, Polish doctors and Romanian nurses working in Italy, and a huge recovery plan is in the making. The world is watching. Our European model will only mean something to the world if we show solidarity within our union’s borders, to each other, and beyond, with our partners globally.  Since the pandemic began, the European Union has been working on all fronts to contain the spread of the coronavirus, support health systems, protect and save lives, and counter the socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic, with historically unprecedented measures at both national and EU level. The Commission will directly support the healthcare systems of EU countries with EUR\xa03\xa0billion from the EU budget, matched with EUR\xa03\xa0billion from the Member States to fund the Emergency Support Instrument and the rescEU common stockpile of equipment. The rescEU initiative helps secure vital equipment, from ventilators to personal protective equipment, and to mobilise medical teams for assistance to the most vulnerable, including in refugee camps. The first hosting state of this stockpile is Romania.  The production of the first ventilators has started, and some 330\xa0000 protective masks were delivered to Spain, Italy and Croatia in the past weeks. Since the beginning of the outbreak, thanks to the EU Civil Protection Mechanism and consular protection coordination, the European Union has brought home over half a million citizens stranded all over the world. Thanks to the Emergency Support Instrument, the European Union has procured another 10 million masks, the first 1.5\xa0million of which have already been delivered to 17 Member States.  I want to thank this House for having launched the ‘Europeans Against COVID—19’ campaign. This Europe Day, the Commission and the Council joined forces with you, and we all pay tribute to those who are making history today, the everyday heroes fighting the coronavirus in our hospitals, in research labs, or by delivering personal protective equipment to those in need, because we know that coronavirus knows no borders.  Tackling this pandemic is a global challenge and the EU is leading the global effort to develop and deploy effective diagnostics, treatments and a vaccine. Without this tool, every country in the world remains vulnerable. Countries and international organisations are joining forces to develop these tools and put the structures in place that ensure they are universally available and affordable. How wealthy a country is should not determine whether its people get to live without this virus.  That is why President von der Leyen launched an international pledging marathon on 4 May. So far, we have raised EUR\xa07.4\xa0billion, and this includes a pledge of EUR\xa01.4\xa0billion from the Commission. But we know that more is needed and I am confident it will come. The crisis gives us an opportunity to lead by example and to reach for our highest aspirations, even when, in the short term, it might be easier to give in to our lowest instincts.  We will be remembered tomorrow for how we act today. Therefore, this crisis forces us to reflect. The pandemic will have a lasting effect, not just on the global system, but also on our daily lives. It is vital that on our path to recovery, we reach out, engage and listen to citizens, at European, national, regional and local level.  The Conference on the Future of Europe is an ideal forum for that and should commence as soon as conditions allow it. The Conference, as a pan—European democratic exercise, can reinforce the link between European citizens and the institutions. It can help rebuild trust and solidarity, even in the new coronavirus reality. The context might have changed, but our determination has not. We want the Conference on the Future of Europe to give citizens a greater say in shaping future EU policies, and we want this to be a joint exercise, involving the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on an equal footing. That is also why any decision on when to launch the Conference must be a joint one taken by all three institutions. Given the circumstances, my colleague and friend, Vice—President\xa0Šuica, who is leading the Commission’s efforts on the Conference, is following this debate remotely from Croatia. She is very much looking forward to joining the debates in this House in a physical mode as soon as possible. In order to be ready for the launch of the Conference under the containment measures scenario, the Commission is exploring digital solutions to enable us to host virtual debates and dialogues. We are working on a multilingual digital platform, allowing citizens to share their results and promote interactive ways for public engagement as part of the Conference. Such a digital platform would be open to all EU institutions. But a digital solution alone cannot reach everyone and cannot compensate for the real deal: face—to—face town hall discussions and workshops across the continent, reaching people from all walks of life. To protect the health of our citizens, we need to be patient and plan accordingly, step by step. Once the Council has adopted its mandate, we will get there. I am confident that the next step, the joint declaration by the Parliament, the Commission and the Council, which is necessary to launch the Conference, is within reach.  A little more than 30 years ago, I was looking through the barbed wire of the infamous Iron Curtain to Austria. This fence was just two kilometres from our apartment and I passed it every single day. I could see the people, the houses and the lights on the other side of the Danube, but I was told by my father that I would never be able to cross the border. Therefore, for me, the Schuman Declaration celebration is also a celebration of the European dream and freedom. I am sure that Robert Schuman would be proud today of how much we have accomplished. But I am also convinced that he would push us higher and further. Therefore, let’s respond to his inspiration by building an even fairer, greener, freer and stronger Europe. (Applause) ', ' Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr\xa0President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, thank you for this opportunity to address you today on the increasingly important issues. Everybody is following closely the developments in the Middle East in the past weeks, both in Israel and in the occupied Palestinian territories. First I would like to start by underlying both the European Union’s and my own personal engagement with both parties. I’ve been in contact with both Israeli Foreign Minister Cohen – even this morning – and the Palestinian Prime Minister. We invited the Prime Minister to Brussels, where we had a very good exchange at the last Foreign Affairs Council in January. This has been coupled with public messaging. You have seen a number of my statements – not my statements – the last one was an a statement of 27\xa0Member States. Sometimes people blame me for the statements of the 27\xa0Member States. It’s not me, it’s the 27 Member States. I am representing the Council, and the Council is the 27 Member States. This was issued last Wednesday. And when we face a difficult situation on the ground with increasing violence and extremism I think it’s crucial that the European Union is united and speaks with one voice, not my voice, the voice of the 27, all together. And we managed to reach an agreement of the 27. And this is the first time it happened for many years, that we had the statement of the 27. And I spoke this morning on the phone with the Israeli Foreign Minister Eli\xa0Cohen, who was not very happy about this debate. He was concerned. He was asking why the European Parliament is interfering in the internal affairs of Israel. He was once again blaming me. Well, sorry, I am coming to the Parliament. The Parliament calls me to discuss something, and I have to come. Which I did. It’s not me who put this title, ‘Deterioration of democracy in Israel and consequences on the occupied territories’, it’s the political groups, and this Parliament is able to discuss about everything they consider important. And that’s what I try to explain to the Israeli minister in a very friendly way: ‘Look, it’s normal that the parliamentarians are concerned about the growing spiral of violence in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories and the need for all sides to de-escalate the situation’. I mentioned this agreement that we reached with the 27 Member States where, of course, we condemn terrorism; of course we fully recognise Israel’s right to defend itself; and we certainly never draw a comparison between operations by the Israeli military and the actions of terrorists. But we have to call for the proportional use of force. No, we don’t want any kind of funding activities that could encourage incitement. Of course we are a strong believer in the two—state solution. And there is no, we believe, viable alternative to that. And with our international partners, we will continue to work for a peaceful solution to the conflict. And I am using this Parliament to say – and I suppose you agree – that the European Union has to engage on looking for peace in the Middle East, and that the Middle East peace process is something that matters for us, and we are engaged on that. Maybe someone doesn’t like it, but we do it because we believe that is our contribution to the security in the region and to our security too. So I hope that today will be a good discussion to show to Minister Cohen that the Parliament is ready to discuss what is happening in the Middle East and how we can contribute to the peace process. And this is not at all to have an anti-Israeli position. Not at all. Second, we have known Israel for its vibrant democracy. That’s true. So vibrant that we have seen five elections in the past three years. Very vibrant. Five elections in three years is quite a dynamic electoral process. And the new government is keen to pursue a judicial reform. And that’s what we want to discuss today: a judicial reform which has led to a heated internal political debate. And everybody knows, because everybody watches TV and reads newspapers, that many Israelis have been demonstrating in the streets. And both the government and opposition are using fierce language. A compromise seems difficult, but as far as I know, talks are ongoing, especially thanks to the efforts of President Herzog. And I don’t want to prejudge the outcome of this debate. I am not part of this debate. I am just saying that this debate is taking place. And I can’t remember you what the President Herzog himself has said. And we are a close observer because Israel is a key partner. Our values are based on our democratic and open society and the rule of law. And we expect this to continue. And if we have concerns, if you have concerns, you will not hesitate to express them and convey them as you do with any part of the world. For example, the Knesset is discussing a bill that could re-establish the death penalty. We know that we are strongly and we are in principle opposed to the death penalty. And for sure today, I’m sure that many members will engage on this clearly. And third, with full respect to the internal political dynamics in Israel, this Chamber is fully empowered to discuss these dynamics and to understand what happens there with respect to our perception of our values and interest in the region. Nothing is strange on that. This cannot be seen as an interference, but a way of showing our interest and our appreciation for the Israeli democracy. And then you present in the title of the debate also the consequences on the Palestinian territories, the occupied Palestinian territories. And I am not inventing the new world if I say that the situation there is grave. And that violence has reached levels unseen since 2005, with an appalling number of victims, including children. Things cannot go on like this. And I made a call with our statement and also with an article published in the Middle East press, asking both sides to act urgently and responsibly. They need to do whatever they can to allow for a change of course. And we have been clear and I will be clear once again: settlements are illegal under international law. Is that being anti-Israeli saying that? No: settlements are illegal under international law. And the expansion must stop, as well as demolition and evictions of Palestinians from their homes. The Israeli Government must seriously counter the violence of settler extremism and hold perpetrators accountable. And military operations must be proportionate and in line with international humanitarian law. It’s difficult not to agree on that. But the Palestinian Authority must act too. They must redouble their efforts in terms of security cooperation and work to prevent acts of terror that have claimed many Israeli lives. It is equally important that the Palestinians work towards reconciliation in order to reunite the Palestinian territories under one single legitimate authority. Palestinian factions should engage constructively in reconciliation talks. Palestinian people deserve the right to vote in national democratic elections to renew the legitimacy of their leadership. This is important also in view of future peace talks. The international community must act as well to help bring about a renewed perspective for peace. And we need renewed international efforts to help both Israelis and Palestinians to think through their options. And in order to contribute to that, on 13\xa0February I met with the Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Faisal, and with Arab League Secretary—General Aboul Gheit, and we agreed to work together towards a viable solution in order to revive and build on the Arab Peace Initiative, also by adding a European peace contribution to it. And in these efforts we will be working closely with other Arab and international partners. We have also supported the work of the US, including on the recent Aqaba Joint Communiqué. And all parties should now respect the agreements that they reached in Aqaba in good faith. And we must help to create the conditions where it will be advantageous for Israelis and Palestinians to go back to the negotiating table and talk. And nothing will make me more happy than to be able to contribute from the European Union to prepare this process. I’m sure everybody in this Chamber agrees that the European Union should do all we can in order to contribute to a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the Middle East and peace between Israel and Palestine. This and nothing else is what is moving us, and in particular me.']"
0,49,0_the_to_and_we,"['the', 'to', 'and', 'we', 'of', 'that', 'climate', 'is', 'for', 'in']","['on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, with regard to climate, those were very poor Council conclusions indeed. Or can I even call them conclusions, because the only thing that leaders could agree on was that they had actually talked about climate. We are in the midst of a rapidly progressing climate crisis and postponement of action is a mistake. This year again looks set to break any sort of records with regard to climate crisis, be it heat waves, droughts, intensity, extreme weather events, Arctic shield loss, etc.  So, let me be very clear. Deciding to talk about climate later is failing to grasp the urgency of this task. We have to act now and we have to act decisively at all levels and also in all policy areas, and the compromise reached by the European Parliament on reducing greenhouse gases by 60% by 2030 is a good step forward. Some of you have said it’s an ambitious target, but it’s not so ambitious: it’s a more realistic target if we really want to save our planet. Member States should sign up to it quickly – to the 60% goal – so we can finally start acting. The climate doesn’t wait and neither should we.  And yes, the economic transformation needed for that is no walk in the park, especially for regions with a long-standing tradition of carbon-intensive economies. That’s why the Parliament is insisting on having a proper-sized Just Transition Fund, among others, as part of a new EU budget, because you need to put the money where your policy targets is. You need to put the money where you want to have the EU fit for the tasks ahead and that requires adequate funding. Any government should know that. We need to have a climate spending target of 30% and a biodiversity target of 10% in order to be up to the tasks ahead. And EU funds also need to advance our Union values. That’s why compliance with rule of law must be an essential criteria for allocating the funds and these are critical elements in the Parliament’s position on the EU budget and recovery fund. It is just inadmissible that the Council disregards such fundamental concerns.  As for Brexit, it’s very sad to see that so much time has passed without any agreement being reached on our future relations. We’re approaching the end of the time limit and I just want to remind us that of course the UK Government could have asked for an extension and they decided not to, but it’s also clear that we cannot accept a deal that would endanger the single market, social rights or environmental standards. So further work is needed on that and we are still extremely sad that Brexit was decided, but now we need to see that we also ensure the Union’s togetherness. We are again holding this meeting under very exceptional circumstances. We’re in the midst of a big, big medical crisis. Let us learn from the EU response in the spring, let us now be more coordinated, more cohesive and make sure that border restrictions are avoided. It’s an exceptional year in many different ways and the Council needs to step up if it is ready to face these challenges. (Applause)', ' President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, I would like to thank you for inviting me to represent the Council in this very topical debate. Climate change is a direct and existential threat that spares no country. The world is already witnessing multiple devastating impacts of climate change. Stepping up global action is therefore more urgent than ever in light of the latest scientific data, especially the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Scientific evidence shows that human-induced global warming has already reached 1°C above pre—industrial levels and is rising at 0.2°C per decade. Without stepping up international climate action, the global average temperature increase could reach 2°C soon after 2060 and continue to rise afterwards. In addition, climate change is increasingly contributing to the deterioration of global biodiversity, water resources and ecosystems. The Arctic is warming at more than twice the global average rate, which is already having serious global, regional and local consequences. However, according to United Nations reports, the nationally determined contribution submitted by parties to the Paris Agreement collectively falls far short of what is required to achieve the long-term goals of the Agreement. Although insufficient progress has been made until now, I see growing momentum for more ambitious action. It is a positive sign that there is increasing knowledge, awareness and concern about climate change and its effects on the world at large. It is particularly encouraging to see that civil society and citizens, especially the youth, are calling for more ambitious action. While human-induced climate change is caused by the way in which our societies have produced and consumed goods during the industrial age up to the present day, the engagement of the young people of today is vital if we want to implement those changes that will ensure that the planet will be fit to live in for future generations. The Climate Action Summit last month was another welcome initiative to mobilise and boost the political will to step up collective efforts in line with the Paris Agreement. It is that shared awareness and collective will to effect change among governments, businesses and society as a whole that is needed in order to bring about the kind of paradigm shift and transformations of economies and societies that are needed to avert catastrophic climate change. The European Union is determined to help raise global ambition and lead the way. It continues to successfully decouple its economic growth from its emissions. From 1990 to 2017 the EU’s economy grew by 58%, while total greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 22%. The EU is set to overachieve its target for greenhouse gas reductions by 2020. It also has a complete package of legislation in place to ensure that it will reach its target for 2030 and thus also deliver its contribution to the Paris Agreement. However, we know that the policies that the EU has in place today will not be enough when we consider the scale of reductions needed in order to reach the long-term temperature goals of the Agreement. Therefore, rapid and far—reaching economic and societal transformation will be required in the coming decades. To this end, as is required of all parties, the EU will submit a long-term strategy for greenhouse gas emissions reductions with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change by 2020. With a view to preparing the European Union’s long-term strategy, the Council has been discussing since November last year how to achieve climate neutrality in line with the Paris Agreement, based on the Commission’s strategic long—term vision – a Clean Planet for all.  The scale of the economic and societal transformations needed in order to achieve climate neutrality in the EU will require efforts from all sectors of the economy. This is why it is so important that this debate is as broad, inclusive and extensive as possible across the EU and its Member States. The transition will affect everyone and it must be carefully managed to ensure that it’s just and socially balanced for all citizens. We need to take into account the specificities of Member States and different regions, ensuring that no one is left behind. On the other hand, the transition also offers great opportunities and potential for economic growth, new jobs and technological development to realise that potential investment into research and innovation needs to be scaled up, while ensuring that our industry is protected from competitive pressures in the global context.  Most Member States agree with the objective of climate neutrality in the EU by 2050 and several Member States have already set national targets contributing to that goal. We are continuing to work towards an agreement that all Member States can sign up to and look forward to the European Council finalising its guidance on the EU’s climate neutral vision before the end of 2019. ', 'deputising for the author. – Madam\xa0President, we now turn to a very important discussion on climate change and the climate conference that we’re going to have in Glasgow in two weeks’ time, which is very clearly going to be one of the most important climate conferences we’ve seen in the last couple of years, where member states of the world need to be stepping up their climate ambition. If you look at climate science and the latest IPCC report that was launched in August this summer, it is becoming more and more clear that the climate impacts are more severe and there are clearer reasons to limit global warming well below two degrees, as we said in the Paris Agreement. We have now very clearly said that we want to keep it below 1.5 degrees.  If you look at the current pledges on the table, we are not on track. What’s even worse is that, at this stage, if we look at all the national pledges around the world, emissions are still expected to rise by 2030. However, the IPCC and climate science is making very clear that by 2030, in order to keep 1.5 degrees within reach, we need a reduction of 45% by 2030 globally. Yet we are not on track if we look at the current pledges.  This is also why the Glasgow moment is so important for raising the ambition of all the different countries in the world. We are very much aware – and this is also described in the resolution – of the achievements and the changes that we have seen in the United States. However, we are, of course, also concerned about the developments in the United States in translating their promises into legislation, and there we see some issues as well, which are sure to be debated in Glasgow. But we are also very concerned about the other big player: China. Their pledges to reach carbon neutrality by 2060 and the peak of emissions by 2030 are insufficient if we look at what needs to happen. We will make that message also very clear.  We also expect stronger commitments from some of our partner countries. A country like Australia is certainly worth mentioning, because they have not yet come forward with climate neutrality targets despite all the other developed countries doing so.  Looking at Europe – and this is clearly in the resolution – we comment on the ‘Fit for 55’ and the package that is there upfront. However, we do realise that steps need to be taken within Europe to translate that into law. The proposals have been made by the Commission, but we as a House, and also the Member States, need to develop on that. Very importantly – and this is probably also an assignment for the European Commission – there is still a lack of mainstreaming of the Green Deal and climate policies into all the areas and fields. I would certainly also like to mention climate finance here.  In this regard, maybe it would sometimes be good to refer to the Paris Agreement, because quite often people talk about the Paris Agreement, but you sometimes wonder whether people have really read the Paris Agreement. Article 2, the backbone of the Paris Agreement, makes very clear that things need to happen on mitigation and adaptation, but the third element of Article\xa02 very clearly also obliges all the signatories of the Paris Agreement to make their financial flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development. So the third pillar of the Paris Agreement, besides mitigation, adaptation, is making the financial flows consistent with our low carbon pathways. Here is another assignment for Europe where action is still to be taken.  Looking at all the issues that are on the table, at the rulebook, we are happy that Europe is finally taking steps on the common five years’ timeframe. Indeed, it was probably about time to take steps there. But we also just want to stress once again that action need to be expected from aviation and maritime. Here too, it is very important to state that aviation and maritime do fall under the Paris Agreement. There was a decision that maybe two other UN bodies could handle this, but maritime and aviation do fall under the Paris commitments. Sometimes some people say that they’re not part of the Paris commitments. I think we need to make that point very clear. For the rest of the resolution, I think it’s very clear on innovation, on competitiveness. It also very much welcomes the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) as part of the ‘Fit for 55’ package, so that this entire package makes very clear that Europe can deliver on the promises it makes, so that we will ensure that in Glasgow we have a leading role. That’s probably our final point. Let this leading role also be seen on some of the sectoral agreements on coal phase-out, the end of the combustion engine. These are the kinds of discussions that are being done in Glasgow as well, and we expect Europe to be at the forefront of that debate.']"
1,39,1_the_to_and_of,"['the', 'to', 'and', 'of', 'in', 'ukraine', 'we', 'russia', 'that', 'is']","['The next item is the debate on the European Council and Commission statements on EU-Russia relations, European security and Russia’s military threat against Ukraine (2022/2518(RSP)).  Dear Colleagues, as announced at the beginning of this part-session, our agenda of this week is dominated by the situation in Ukraine.  Today, we are starting our day with the most pressing debate on EU-Russia relations, European security and Russia’s military threat against Ukraine amidst intense international diplomatic exchanges to de-escalate the situation.  I am pleased to welcome the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the High\xa0Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep\xa0Borrell\xa0Fontelles, who are with us to discuss the latest developments on the ground in the wider context of European security and EU-Russia relations. Welcome to the plenary. On behalf of the European Parliament, we have repeatedly expressed solidarity with the people of Ukraine as they continue to face the uncertainty of the past weeks and fear of Russian military aggression. What we are witnessing here is also a threat to peace in Europe. I want to recall that, in September last year, the European Parliament adopted a resolution that called for containing Russia’s influence in the EU and its Eastern Neighbourhood and, in December last year, we also adopted a resolution where we criticised the actions of the Russian authorities and underlined our preparedness to ‘agree swiftly on further joint action’, including sanctions.  Today, just after this debate, we will vote on granting EUR\xa01.2 billion of ‘macro—financial assistance to Ukraine’. I would like to thank the European Commission for this timely proposal to support Ukraine’s financial stability and resilience in the current difficult circumstances.  Also later today, the Conference of Presidents will discuss the declaration on the situation in Ukraine. I would like to stress that, while we urge for a de-escalation of the current tension between Ukraine and Russia, this Parliament stands ready to support swift, forceful and concrete action, in coordination with other European institutions. The Union’s unity and close cooperation with our partners are key for the European Union to play a strong role on the international stage and to contribute to peace and security. We would be interested to know how lessons learned from the current situation will also be reflected in the works on the future Strategic Compass for the EU. Finally, I would like to thank you, President Michel, President von den Leyen and High\xa0Representative\xa0Borrell, for your engagement in the intense consultation on identifying ways to address the situation at the EU’s eastern borders and your efforts to uphold fundamental principles of the existing European security architecture.  Without further delay, I would like to give the floor to President of the European Council, Charles\xa0Michel, for your statement.', ' Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members. Last year will be remembered in history for Russia’s brutal war of aggression and our unprecedented unity and solidarity with Ukraine. I will always remember how we welcomed millions of Ukrainian refugees, and how we remain strong and determined and stand by Ukraine to this day and will continue to do so.  But when I went home to Sweden during the break, what did people say? What on earth is going on in Brussels? Instead of solidarity, they talked about suitcases full of cash. When I spoke here in Strasbourg last, in December, I could feel the shock, shame and anger in this room – outrage that the alleged criminal behaviour of so few put at risk all the good work of so many. But I also felt the determination, the conviction and the will to learn, to change, to reform. In December, trust was broken. Now we must pick up the pieces. Now we must rebuild better and stronger than before.  So I welcome the measures announced last week to increase integrity, independence and accountability in the Parliament. That’s a good start. But we must do more. Nothing but the highest standards will do for all institutions. That’s why it’s critical to have uniform, strong rules in place, guarded by a joint ethics body for all to answer to. Vice-President Jourová is in constant contact with Parliament and the Council, and the Commission is ready to put forward a proposal.  We can build on the Interinstitutional Agreement on the transparency register signed two years ago – a major milestone in fostering a common transparency culture. Like all my colleagues, I can only meet businesses and organisations on the transparency register. We are uncompromising in upholding the highest standards of transparency about who tries to influence us. It’s normal for us to meet with civil society, with businesses and other partners. As politicians and leaders, we must always be ready to listen. We must always listen to words, but never ever to favours, gifts, bribes. That is totally unacceptable.  That’s why we protect whistleblowers who report foul play. They are essential for the functioning of our democracy. We protect them with our own internal rules and with our EU laws – the Directive on whistleblower protection – and the EU Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, investigates allegations of wrongdoing. We will be debating one such case tomorrow, triggered by a whistleblower.  The European Public Prosecutor’s Office is proving its value day in, day out, defending the EU budget. It was the EPPO that requested to lift the immunity of two Members of the European Parliament in December, and in its first seven months of operation, the EPPO investigated more than EUR\xa05\xa0billion in losses to the EU budget.  When we talk about fighting corruption, we must be clear: transparency and accountability will not be enough. Corruption is a serious crime and we must fight it with the full force of law. 60% of criminal organisations are engaged in corruption. Criminals are buying people, buying politicians, buying power. Soon, I will propose a new law to criminalise all forms of corruption, with unified definitions of corruption and harmonised penalties across the European Union. We are shaping the proposal as we speak, and I promise you that we will be as ambitious as we can, as tough as we possibly can, and give police and courts the tools they need to eradicate corruption.  The scandal we are discussing goes beyond criminal corruption. In the media there are disturbing allegations about activities of foreign states, foreign agents. It’s normal for us to talk to foreign politicians, businesspeople, leaders. What’s unacceptable is any malicious interference in our internal affairs, in our democracies. High Representative / Vice-President Josep Borrell raised investigations with counterparts in Qatar and Morocco, making clear that we need thorough investigations. There can be no impunity for corruption.  What cannot wait is the defence of our democracies. Soon the Commission will present a defence of democracy package to bring covert foreign influence and shady funding to light against third country entities, covertly impacting public opinion and undermining democracy. We must now urgently put plans and proposals into action to combat corruption and uphold transparency, accountability and honesty, both in our institution and on our continent.  You can count on me that I will do everything in my power to this end, and so will the entire Commission. And I know that I can count on you. I know that in this struggle we are partners. I know that this scandal affects all of you here in the European Parliament very personally: you are sad, angry, but also determined to act. And I ask you to take inspiration from all we have done in the last three years. We’ve dealt with COVID. We are dealing with this war. We can clearly also deal with corruption and root it out wherever we find it.', ' Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Madam\xa0President, our relations with Turkey, from these three events that the President has mentioned, show that our relations with Russia continue to deteriorate.  These three particular issues that you want us to address today are clear examples of that. First, Russia’s destabilisation policy against Ukraine, despite the ongoing withdrawal of its military from the Ukrainian borders, which is good news, but they were there for a long time with a lot of resources. Second, there are worrying internal developments, particularly in the case of Mr\xa0Navalny. Yes, he has stopped his hunger strike, but what has happened has happened. Third, the recent diplomatic crisis after the finding of criminal acts in the Czech Republic carried out by Russian intelligence services, as the Czech Republic’s authorities claim.  So our relations with Russia are once again at a low point. Unfortunately, we cannot rule out that this negative trend will continue and that we will reach even more dangerous levels of deterioration. Without wanting to feed further a dynamic of escalation – nothing is further from my intention, let that by clear – we are nevertheless showing that we will not accept intimidation tactics and that we have to respond to them if they happen. Let’s go first to the Russian military aggression against Ukraine. The recent military build—up in the proximity of the Ukrainian borders – more than 100\xa0000 soldiers – and the illegal annexation of Crimea has severely affected and aggravated the security situation in the region. Last week, we had an in—depth exchange with the European Union Foreign Ministers and the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba, and our message was clear: the Russian actions are completely unacceptable and we firmly support the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders.  Russia must cease its provocation and cooperate in a de—escalation of the tensions instead of portraying itself as a neutral mediator. That’s what Russia is doing now – they don’t have anything to do with the conflict in Ukraine; they are just there to try to mediate in an external problem in which they don’t intervene directly. This pretence must be debunked because, up to now, Russia has shown no willingness to end the conflict on terms that would safeguard Ukrainian sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence. For Russia, the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements is not a key condition. For us, it is. It’s a key condition for a substantial improvement in our relations. For the European Union, an independent and prosperous Ukraine is an indispensable element of European stability and security, and that’s why we want Ukraine to continue the pace of reform, because there is no better way to face Russia than to be a country with a fully democratic system, free of corruption and using our resources, that we are very ready to provide, in order to improve the quality of the governance of the country. Looking ahead, we need to continue to pass coordinated messages of steadfast support for Ukraine. If we participate in the Crimean Platform Summit this August, we should also stand ready to look into options for additional responses should Russia re—escalate or cross a red line.  Second, on the health situation of the Russia opposition politician, Alexei\xa0Navalny, there our voice has been very strong and united. We have made an EU statement, on behalf of the 27, calling on the Russian authorities to grant Mr\xa0Navalny immediate access to the doctors that he trusts. The Russian authorities are responsible for his safety and health and will be accountable for it. Finally, last week, Mr\xa0Navalny was finally taken to a civilian hospital and examined by independent doctors, as we were requiring. Soon afterwards, he called off his hunger strike. We will maintain our strong calls – the same message that I went to Moscow to tell the Russian Minister, eye to eye and face to face – for ensuring the right conditions for Mr\xa0Navalny’s speedy recovery, on top of international efforts. As you know, last Wednesday thousands of courageous people took to the streets across Russia to further demand freedom and justice. Instead, in response, the prosecutor’s office asked that Mr\xa0Navalny’s anti-corruption network be qualified as an extremist organisation. I certainly expressed our grave concern about this yesterday. I am quite pessimistic. Unfortunately, we cannot expect that things will improve during the next electoral process in Russia in the September Duma elections, which will bring more limitations to fundamental freedoms in the run-up to these elections.  Third, on the involvement of the Russian military intelligence in the explosion at an ammunition depot in the Czech Republic in 2014. It’s true that it’s seven years ago, but even so it happened. The conclusion by the Czech authorities that officers of the Russian military intelligence, the GRU, perpetrated this attack, causing the deaths of two Czech citizens, are extremely serious. The fact that it happened seven years ago doesn’t decrease the gravity of these facts. This is not about military intelligence. This is about a grave criminal offence that runs counter to Russia’s international obligations and such behaviour cannot be accepted. That’s why I have to insist once again on the idea that we have to use the three verbs that I have used: to contain, to engage and to push back. I will go back to this idea after listening to all of you. Let me clearly state our full support and solidarity with the Czech Republic. The asymmetric response by Russia – expelling diplomats and now threatening a limitation in the number of local staff – is being met by a determined response from the European Union and its Member States.  To finish, let me remind you that our policy framework towards Russia, based on the five principles, continues. We will work on internal resilience, fighting against hybrid and cyber threats, strengthening our engagement with our eastern neighbours, including the Russian people, stepping up support to Russian civil society and human rights defenders, and by enhancing people—to—people contact. We will continue to signal to Russia that we are ready to engage in areas of clear interest. This is also true. We have to engage. I said contain, push back and engage, because we need to engage with Russia in areas which are clearly of shared interest. I mentioned the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and I can add climate change. We need to maintain channels of communication with Moscow. I am ready to do so, and we also stand ready to improve relations, if needed and if possible, with the Russian Government if they show a genuine willingness to do so, and certainly with full respect for our values, principles, and interest. To finish, I have to say that, unhappily, I see a worrying trend from the Russian authorities that seems to be choosing deliberately to deepen the confrontation with the West – with us – including through continued attacks of disinformation and other negative activities. We must therefore define a modus vivendi that will avoid permanent confrontation with a neighbour who seems to have decided to act as adversary. I am looking forward to listening to you and to knowing your positions, that I know will be many and varied, and to taking some stock of them in my concluding remarks, because I think that we have to be prepared for a long and hard period in our relations with Russia.  I thank you, Madam President and Members of the European Parliament, for giving me this opportunity. Let’s make good use of it. ']"
2,24,2_the_and_to_that,"['the', 'and', 'to', 'that', 'we', 'of', 'is', 'in', 'it', 'our']","['on behalf of the Renew Group. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for coming here and for starting the infringement procedures. I think that is most welcome and we knew that it had been in the pipeline for quite some time. However, this House has been debating the problems with golden passport since 2014. Why did it take so long? Why did the authorities wait so long to intervene? Why did we have to wait for brave journalists to uncover the scandals that we all suspected for a long time? And some of these journalists have paid a very high price – the highest price, as we know. But journalists are not responsible for law enforcement. The authorities are, and the authorities are failing. Those who have a legitimate interest in investing in the European economy can do so without problem, and no golden passport nor golden visa scheme can ever really be clean and legitimate – because due diligence that relies on cooperation with the Russian and the Chinese and the Saudi authorities, frankly, can never be watertight – and I’m being polite here. Despite the fancy names of the schemes – you know ‘residency by investment’ sounds nice, evokes these images of villas and yachts, and what have you – in reality, they are just a golden backdoor into the European Union for criminals, criminals. It’s not investment; it is criminal money. Now, we need a full ban, and we’re calling on the European Commission, not for the first time, to propose legislation, and I’m proud to say that at the initiative of my group Renew Europe, the Committee for Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) Committee is going to draft a legislative initiative calling for a ban on golden passports. But of course this is a national competence. You know, national governments cannot sell what is not theirs to sell, and that is EU citizenship. It isn’t theirs, they cannot sell it. So are governments, is the Council finally also going to take responsibility, or will they continue to knowingly facilitate criminals? The final question, Commissioner: will you also address the ‘legacy’ of those who have already received a Cypriot or Maltese or other passport? Will there be a second screening to see what kind of people we have actually elevated to the status of EU citizen?', ' Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam\xa0President, I want to thank the honourable Members for this debate and for all your opinions and views. For me it is extremely important to hear the opinions of this House because this is the first broad debate about if, and how, to regulate the Internet if I may simplify that. And I take several main messages.  First, what I heard from the vast majority of you is: it’s time to get to work. If we are not ambitious to become the rule-makers we will continue to be the rule-takers, the rules which have been created in Silicon Valley and which are imposed on our territory in the EU. So it’s time to get to work with a sense of urgency and I very much count on the European Parliament and your approach to adopt the legislation which the Commission proposed soon enough. Also because we see a lot of impatience on the side of some Member States who want to go their own way. They want to have their own rules for the Internet and I think that it was quite clear also from this debate that we want to have a pan-European smart solution without any fragmentation by Member States.  The second main message which I got is that we are searching and working on the ideologically-neutral solution that the rules we are going to adopt should not be left or right, and that we will seek the solution which will protect the freedom of speech as the primary principle. So these are the main messages I took from this very important debate.  Coming back to the rule-makers, what we are doing is the continuation of the effort of the EU to be the rule-maker with global effect. We already managed to do that with the GDPR where we said that individual people must have the right to have their identity, their privacy, under control. And now we are coming with a set of, I hope, consistent rules which are also consistent with the GDPR and its philosophy. We are coming with the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act, the European Democracy Action Plan, and by all that we want to prove that the EU has a very healthy instinct when it comes to the risks which we see on the Internet and which can cause big harm to our societies.  What I heard from many of you was that the digital big tech grabbed too much power and too little responsibility. I would add I agree with that. The platforms captured a lot of public space. I sometimes say that they privatised the public space, and this is a public space without any public scrutiny whatsoever. So this is also our task: to demand more transparency and more accountability, because what’s happening online is heavily influencing real life.  I think it was Mr Tudorache who said that there is no difference between online and offline, that it’s one world. I tend to agree with that. On the other hand, it’s quite easy to blame the Internet and platforms for all our troubles. I think that we should really take a lesson from what happened in the US at the beginning of January. The platforms for the transmitters of the messages of the former President Trump who was inciting violence, whipping up the crowd who then invaded the Capitol, and there were victims, there were dead people. So I think this is also a very strong goal on all of us who have influence on public opinion and on the reaction of our society to be more responsible and to be aware that social media can be a weapon, a dangerous weapon in our hands.  I am not calling for self-censoring for politicians. I am calling for more responsibility and awareness of the consequences when we use these social platforms and social media. I would like to recommend that you read Madeleine Albright’s book Fascism: A Warning. She speaks about social media as a weapon when it is used by bad people, when it appears in bad hands.  Let me react to several comments regarding disinformation in the time of COVID. I’m sure you know that the Commission has an agreement with big tech to do more against disinformation. So it’s not true that they have just started now, and I appreciate the recent announcement of Facebook that they want to do more against disinformation relating to vaccination. The agreement is simple. I wanted them to enable more space for information from authorities, from health authorities, from those who are responsible for communication and for providing the people with trustworthy and evidence-based information. For the health sector I think that is a very clear message: if you do not occupy the space it will be occupied by disinformation. The Ministers of Health are aware of that and they do their best. I have to praise them for everything they are doing in this very difficult moment and crisis, and they are doing their best to occupy the space with reliable information. The thing is that the people have to trust the information provided by the health authorities.  The fight against disinformation also contains what we offer or what we propose. It contains fact-checking. Honourable Members, let me do this now. I have to react to Mr Haider who said that the EU has not invested anything into the development and production of vaccination. This is fake news, and I think that if something like that is said, it’s also our obligation to come with the facts and deny that. I also want to react because we speak here about the freedom of speech. I want to react to those who were mentioning the situation in Poland. I think we all have seen the black screens. The black screens are quite telling. I think they are screaming. Today it’s a question of protest of the media in Poland, expressed in a black screen. Tomorrow black screens might become a sad everyday reality. We also need to protect the freedom of speech by supporting independent media, not by suppressing them with additional financial burdens.  This doesn’t apply only to Poland. We have recommended many times to the Member States that they should support also financially media who are also the frontrunners in the COVID crisis, media which were already before the COVID crisis under big financial distress because the business model has changed brutally. The money from advertisers is being shifted to the online sphere which we keep speaking about today, and so we need to guarantee that the media can do their job because they have a very important role in our democratic societies.  So coming back to the law which we are now analysing. I have to say that we always advise the Member States to support media, as I said, but coming to the law, we are aware of the draft law and we need to look into it in more detail. We expect Member States to ensure that their fiscal or other policies will not affect the commitment to ensuring a free independent and diverse media ecosystem. I have to add that about the legislative process, which is ongoing in Poland, that it is important to consult such legislation also with the media sector, and I understand from the recent information from Poland that this is foreseen.  I am sorry, I probably was longer than I wanted to be, but I really wanted to react to many of your very important opinions, which I had to take.', 'on behalf of the Renew Group. – Madam President, Mr Commissioner, dear colleagues, the trouble with authoritarian politics is that without pushback, it becomes ever more aggressive and dangerous. The European Union has learned this the hard way with Putin. But it seems to me that we haven’t really learned this lesson when it comes to our own values and rule of law in Europe.  We now have a Member State government that has stifled independent media, captured independent institutions, which is spreading hate against minorities, and where billions of EU money has disappeared into the hands of oligarchs close to the ruling party. We also have a Member State whose government works to dismantle the independent judiciary by targeting judges, by firing them.  Now, all of this takes place in the EU, a democratic community, with EU financial support and despite the many mechanisms and tools that we have in place to protect our values.  Today we are here to discuss Article 7, which if you look at it, is a fairly straightforward procedure with hearings, with recommendations and ultimately sanctions. So on paper, it is a pretty powerful tool. In practice, the Council has made it toothless and quite opaque. Hearings are random and non—transparent, and even today, even after everything that has happened in Hungary, the Council has failed to even agree that this constitutes a serious breach of EU values, despite no unanimity needed for that statement.  Now thankfully, and after much hesitation, the Commission has finally activated the Conditionality Regulation. But even here there is a risk that the scope will be too narrow and that it will fail to address the systemic deficiencies and risks that stem from the absence of checks and balances in the rule of law, which is precisely what this regulation is for.  Colleagues, I remember last time around many of you were saying when we had this debate that the situation is now unprecedented with a full—scale war on our borders. And now here we are four weeks later after the massacres in Bucha, Mariupol and many others, and what strikes me is that I hear many voices, even in this House, saying that while in times of war we should relax our principles and our rules when it comes to defending democracy in Europe.  But I strongly believe that this is precisely the opposite of what is needed. After Putin’s invasion, many have said that we are now locked in a broader, protracted conflict between autocracy and democracy, between Vladimir Putin’s model and our European model, between tyranny and freedom, between brute force and the rule of law. And I agree. I agree that this is this is the conflict that we’re facing, which is precisely why, now more than ever, it’s important to protect our democratic model in Europe, why we cannot relent, why we cannot now relax our rules, because otherwise, how are we going to prevail in this conflict that is upon us?']"
3,24,3_the_and_to_of,"['the', 'and', 'to', 'of', 'we', 'in', 'for', 'european', 'that', 'is']","[' Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, Madam Vedrenne, who is here in lieu of the rapporteur, first, I want to welcome this report and I would like to express my personal gratitude for this very valuable work.  Traineeships are an important pathway for young people to enter the labour market and gain practical experience but first they need to be quality traineeships and second they cannot be for free.  Young people have been vocal about this issue, which also came out of the Conference on the Future of Europe. Many young people, you have mentioned it, have suffered from the impact of COVID-19, and many continue to suffer from the increasing cost of living. Young people deserve our respect and their commitment deserves our recognition.  In 2020, we pledged in our youth employment support package to step up EU support to increase youth employment, notably reinforcing the Youth Guarantee, which has helped over 50 million young people since 2013. This package also included a modernised European framework for vocational education and training and a renewed impetus for apprenticeships.  We need to keep working towards the EU targets set in the European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan of 78\xa0% employment rates and also to reduce the rate of young people not in employment, educational training, which is currently at 11.7\xa0%. Quality traineeships can contribute to achieving these targets and we fully agree with Parliament’s political objective to improve their quality and inclusiveness.  A recent Eurobarometer survey on traineeships showed, for example, that almost 70\xa0% of trainees managed to find a job following their traineeship. However, there is equally room for improvement and I therefore welcome the draft resolution.  Vulnerable groups, including those with disabilities, should have equal opportunities in doing a traineeship, regardless of their background. We also agree that trainees should be treated fairly for the work that they do, and we cannot allow, under no circumstances, that traineeships are misused to replace regular jobs, and very often not paid.  This is why in the follow up on the Year of Youth, and as part of the Year of Skills, the 2023 Commission work programme includes an initiative to update the current quality framework for traineeships. The Commission work programme is also clear in stating that we want to address issues like fair remuneration and social protection.  I thank the Parliament for its valuable contribution, in particular for the additional quality principles both regarding the social rights of trainees and the learning content of traineeships. I also take note of the European Parliament’s request for legislative action.  I confirm that in line with the commitment by President von der Leyen, the Commission will respond with a legislative act in full respect of the proportionality, subsidiarity and better law-making principles. In doing so, we will of course, consult the European social partners who may decide to engage negotiations and that act by means of agreements.  The Commission will do its utmost to take into account the elements raised in the resolution, while fully respecting – we are obliged to do so – legal boundaries set by the Treaties. We will also ensure not to weaken the existing legal acquis; the draft motion and its annexes currently contain elements which indeed require an in-depth analysis.  We will also take into account the impacts on small- and medium-sized enterprises. The report calls for revision of the equality acquis here. We strongly believe that independent and empowered equality bodies will strengthen the effectiveness and enforcement of the Employment Equality Directive.  We will uphold our commitments made in 22 European Year of Youth and the European Year of Skills and in the Conference on the Future of Europe. And we will uphold our commitment to you to respond to every legislative own initiative report.  We need to put in place the necessary policy, regulatory and financial measures to provide young people with the opportunities and instruments they need to succeed in their life. Their talents and innovation capacity cannot be used for free. This is also an issue for social responsibility of companies.  Investing in young people is key to build a strong human capital and to ensure the prosperity, fairness and competitiveness of the European Union. We all share the objective of empowering our young generation. Let me again express my sincere gratitude for your valuable report. ', ' Member of the Commission. – Madam\xa0President, I thank the Members for today’s very rich and, I must say, very stimulating debate, which has shown the strong commitment of the European Parliament to the European pillar of social rights and its implementation.  Let me be very clear. We have formulated new headline targets for 2030, but our action to reach them must start now, and indeed it has already started.  It must be joint action by all from those who bear concrete responsibilities at all levels: the European Parliament, obviously, the national parliaments, national governments, regional and local authorities, social partners and civil society actors.  First of all, we want to achieve an employment rate of 78% – as I’ve already said – in 2030. So there is a need to support the creation of more and better jobs. Here I have to be very clear. We have done a lot to preserve jobs, to keep people in jobs, but we have done a lot also to preserve companies, especially a lot of SMEs. And we have to do a lot to create new companies, new industries in Europe, and that’s also a very strong dimension of this Commission’s policies.  Work for jobs is why we put forward the Commission recommendation on effective active support for employment. It sets out guidance on investing in people and easing job—to—job transitions for those who are at risk of redundancy or are already unemployed. We also need to pursue our efforts to support young people. They are particularly vulnerable to this crisis. They are suffering a lot. They have lost their precarious jobs – if they had one. Therefore, better jobs, more secure jobs, highly productive and skilled jobs. This is what we are aiming at for our young, because it cannot be that with a recovery, the only prospects that we are offering them is again precarious jobs that they may lose from one day to another. The idea, this wrong alternative, that of better any job than no job, is a false alternative. What we have to do is really work on good jobs, investing in people. Beyond the recovery effort, it is essential to support the participation of women in the labour market. We need to at least halve the employment gap, promote access to early childhood education and care, and further promote the work—life balance.  Better jobs mean striving for better working conditions. We have already proposed ambitious legislation on adequate minimum wages. Two weeks ago, the Commission launched a consultation of EU social partners on decent working conditions and social protection for people working through platforms.  A major priority must concern skills and equality. If we are talking about effective labour market policies, we cannot emphasise enough the importance of skills for jobs. At least 60% of adults should participate in training every year by 2030. Skills empower people to adapt to change and skills are an ever more important source of our global competitiveness. The different actions and our European skills agenda are crucial to this end, and we will only successfully manage the green transition and the digital change transformation if we invest a lot in skills – and not just in the skills of those who are already skilled, but also in those who have lower skills, giving them better opportunities on the labour market. We must advance gender equality and equal opportunities for all, with a particular focus on youth. Last week’s proposal for a directive on binding pay transparency and enforcement measures and a new disability rights strategy are crucial.  (The speaker was interrupted by the European Anthem). (Laughter and applause)  That’s great. That’s really great. Thank you very much. Lastly, I want to emphasise the fight against rising inequality and poverty. This stands at the heart of the action plan. We want the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion to be reduced by at least, I insist, at least, 15 million. The fight against poverty requires stronger safety nets for those in need and robust social protection systems.  Later this month, we will table the long—anticipated proposal for a European child guarantee, which was born here in this Parliament. We will also launch a European platform on combating homelessness, and next year we will come forward with a Council recommendation on minimum income. I agree social investments are key and, particularly in this recovery, we have to build a more resilient society and therefore we have to mobilise European funds and support social enterprises by proposing a social economy action plan.  Dear President, honourable Members, we can only achieve our ambitions for a green and digital transition by covering also the social dimension. Social progress has to be embedded in our recovery strategy and to become a driving principle of our post—COVID European agenda.  That is what’s at stake in Porto – an economy that works for all people. That’s what we are aiming at. ', 'on behalf of the S&D Group. – Mr\xa0President, the European budget for next year is a key moment for the implementation of the multiannual financial framework (MFF) and the recovery plan. This is why the S&D Group in the European Parliament calls for more ambition coming from the Commission and the Member States in the efforts to implement the multiple programmes and initiatives designed to manage a pandemic, and prepare for future challenges linked to the digital and green transformations. Investing more in healthcare, education and social infrastructure, prioritising research and innovation, supporting our start-ups and SMEs, helping vulnerable groups and promoting gender equality should be an integral part of what we plan for the future of Europe. We call for a citizen-centred EU budget that brings an added value across Europe. We believe that the European Pillar for Social Rights represents a central guiding line for what we want in terms of the relaunch of Europe. The EU budget should therefore allocate proper resources and fully integrate the results of the Porto Social Summit. Through our amendments, we managed to promote a stronger social response to the crisis, coming up with detailed guidelines for what needs to happen in health, education, fighting unemployment, combating poverty, and supporting children and young people, promoting digital skills and the green transformation. We need an inclusive budget that leaves no one behind. The most affected sectors, like tourism and the hospitality sector, the cultural and creative sector, the education and the agricultural sector, should all be referred to with precise policies. We should deal with all the challenges existing at local but also at global level. Therefore I am really happy to see that our amendment calling for Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia to become part of the Schengen area has been taken on board in the final report. All citizens should be at the centre of the MFF and the recovery plan. This is why the European Union should push for a stronger and better answer to the crisis by making sure that all Member States have the capacity to make 2022 a full absorption year. Cohesion in this regard is the key. We cannot repeat the mistakes made at the beginning of the previous MFF. We need to increase transparency, but also reduce the bureaucracy surrounding EU funds. Unfortunately, some governments – like in my own country, Romania – are incapable of preparing a proper answer to the crisis using European funds, and this is where we need to intervene. The European Parliament should be an active actor of this relaunch plan. We are ready to do our part and we should understand that we are in all of this together. It is essential for us to be proactive and respect our commitments in the MFF.  We reiterate our support for the European Child Guarantee, the European Youth Guarantee, the EU4Health programme, the European Social Fund, the Erasmus programme, Creative Europe, and other programmes. The pandemic has shown us that we also need a European health union at the same time. And of course we must also think about our responsibility at global level: our international partners need our help. We are the voice of EU citizens, and we should act as such in the negotiations with the Council and the Commission. Let us work together in finding the best solutions for a social, green, digital and inclusive European budget.']"

First, on the G7 summit, which the UK will host in Cornwall this weekend, as President Charles Michel has just underlined, the overall mission of the EU for the meeting is clear: to support an agenda for global action built on a strong commitment to international cooperation, multilateralism and an open, resilient, rules-based international order.  Here there are a couple of elements. First, the COVID—19 pandemic needs global cooperation in order to be overcome. We need solidarity. We need to ensure early access to vaccines and treatments everywhere. While vaccination campaigns are making progress around the world, more needs to be done. President von der Leyen explained clearly what we are doing in terms of exports, donating vaccines, and supporting the production of vaccines, but more needs to be done. We need a stronger multilateral response. We call for closing the financial gap for access to the COVID—19 Tools Accelerator, and we have been the main supporters of COVAX, but we cannot be multilateralists alone. All the advanced G7 economies should share doses through COVAX.  Secondly, solidarity also remains key in dealing with the economic effects of the pandemic, as we expect uneven recoveries and deepening of inequalities. We need to work together to fight hunger and poverty around the world. In this respect, a new general allocation of special drawing rights, unprecedented in terms of size, is under preparation by the IMF. EU Member States have supported this initiative and are discussing how best to channel these resources to the most vulnerable countries.  Thirdly, we also need to better prepare the world for the next pandemic. A number of initiatives are ongoing with the recent Rome Declaration of Principles released by the Global Health Summit and discussed at WHO, including on an international treaty on pandemics. This should not be a missed opportunity. Furthermore, the UK G7 Presidency has put forward a very ambitious agenda on climate and biodiversity against the background of the two important events of this year, the COP26 on climate and the COP15 on biodiversity.  Success at the COP26 will depend on the level of ambition of all parties. The EU has already submitted its ambitious nationally determined contribution (NDC). It will be important that the G7 shows an equally strong level of ambition and leadership, with clear commitments. The EU is also committed to working with the G7 partners to adopt new, ambitious global targets on biodiversity for the COP15. Our own EU 2030 biodiversity strategy is a testimony to that.  Finally, another very important topic regards international taxation. We are at a crucial juncture on the OECD—led negotiation for a broader overhaul of the rules on international taxation of the largest multinational enterprises. We welcome the fact that the G7 has reached a consensus on the framework for an overall agreement, and we hope that this agreement at G7 level will indeed form a good basis for further work, both within the G20 and at the level of the OECD. Turning now to the upcoming summit with the United States, I would like to stress the symbolic importance of this event. It will take place as a part of President Biden’s first foreign trip, seven years after the previous summit, upon an invitation by President Charles Michel. The United States and the EU represent 780\xa0million people who share democratic values. It is also the largest economic relationship in the world. We have a chance and a responsibility to help people make a living, keep them safe, fight climate change and stand up for democracy and human rights.  We would like to see this summit agree with the US on an ambitious cooperation agenda in four key areas: fighting the COVID pandemic and driving forward a sustainable global recovery; second, protecting our planet and fostering green growth; third, strengthening trade, investment and technological cooperation; and fourth, building a more democratic, peaceful and secure world. We expect that leaders will agree on a very concrete and ambitious set of deliverables in all these four areas and we believe that this event has the potential to be a key milestone in renewing and re—energising our partnership.  A strong transatlantic partnership is vital to ensure, and to contribute to, our common security, stability and prosperity. A renewed transatlantic agenda is necessary to find joint answers to global challenges and make it deliver for our citizens. We hope that the summit will not be a one—off event and that regular exchanges between the EU and the United States will resume at different levels. Discussions in preparation for the summit are under way, both with EU Member States and on the US side, and I am sure that today’s exchange will provide a timely and important input into the summit preparations. I’m very keen to listen to your views. Thank you very much for your attention. ', ' Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I am very pleased to see the ongoing commitment of this House to the safety and health of workers in the European Union. I fully share your engagement for safe and fair working conditions for all workers. I particularly want to thank the rapporteur, Madam Vind, and all those who have worked on this excellent report for this commitment.  First of all, I agree with you that prevention is key and that nobody should suffer from work-related diseases or accidents. This is why this strategic framework on health and safety at work 2021-2027 adopted last year puts forward the vision-zero approach under which various actions are being put in place, including awareness-raising and capacity-building. First, your report refers to Principle 10 of the Pillar of Social Rights that clearly states that workers have the right to a high level of protection of health and safety at work. This should apply to all workers, but I must say this should also apply to those who are self-employed. They deserve the same protection. Together, we have delivered the first commitment of the European cancer plan by adopting the fourth amendment of carcinogens, and with the gene’s directive, to protect workers from cancer.  I must say that I particularly appreciated also, the provision that improves the protection of those who work in the health sector; the majority, by the way, are women. They are exposed to dangerous substances. They have to handle the treatment of patients and many patients suffering from cancer. So here we have set an important standard, which now has to be implemented in the health sector. But we don’t stop here. Preparatory work on future batches of hazardous substances is ongoing. For instance, before the end of this year, the Commission aims to adopt the next proposal, revising the exposure limit values for lead, major reprotoxicants and di- isocyanates as well as to put forward its plans for revising a further 25 substances.  The Parliament has been particularly sensitive to the need to reduce workers exposure to asbestos. The rapporteur mentioned it; we had the debate not so long ago on the dangers of asbestos. I fully share this determination. As I have already informed your Parliament, the Commission will present a communication setting out measures under existing and new instruments in view of addressing the risks from asbestos. Your report mentions the terrible figures. Asbestos claims around 88\xa0000 lives annually in the European Union and is responsible for 45% of all lung cancers. This is not a fatality. We have the possibility to reduce rapidly, and massively, these casualties. Therefore, we will also present a legislative proposal to lower the existing occupational exposure limit under the Asbestos at Work Directive. I agree with you that further action is also needed to protect workers from psychosocial risks. We strongly believe that the measures in this field must include tailor-made tools adjusted to specific national, local, socio-economic and cultural context. We are working on further actions in this area. For example, EU-OSHA 2023-3025 healthy workplaces campaign: safe and healthy work in the digital age, will, among others, address psychosocial and ergonomic risks. I know that your Parliament is very sensitive also to the issue of mental health, and this is a real issue. We have seen it during the pandemic, but mental health has affected a lot of young people, but more and more, it affects also many workers, more and more workers to burnouts, to stress, and I have read in your report that 51% of workers say that stress is common in their workplace. So we have really to develop practices, approaches to limit this impact on mental health through the working conditions. We are also ensuring a proper follow-up of the Parliament’s resolution on telework and the right to disconnect, in line with the Commission’s commitment to respond to resolutions from the European Parliament based on Article 225. The role of social partners is key in the realm, therefore, the Commission stands ready to support social partners in finding commonly agreed solutions to address these challenges and encourages social partners to follow up on their 2020 framework agreement on digitalisation. At the same time, the Commission is putting forward a number of actions to gather evidence and data on telework and the right to disconnect.  By the way, next week, together with the Parliament, we are organising a conference on the right to disconnect. This includes also a study analysing the trends and regulatory and policy landscape of telework and the right to disconnect in Europe, in the context of digitalisation and the future of work.  As we move forward, we are drawing lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic and looking at ways to increase preparedness for future crises. The commission continues working on an in-depth assessment on the effects of the pandemic and the efficiency of our frameworks to develop emergency procedures and guidance in any potential future health crisis. Particular attention will also be paid to health workers who put their lives on the line for us. Effective application and enforcement for the existing EU-OSHA legislation is paramount to properly protect workers in the EU and, at the same time, it contributes to the promotion of a level playing field in the Union. While the enforcement is mainly a national competence, the Senior Labour Inspectors’ Committee promotes effective and proper application of the EU legislation across Member States. I have to say that labour inspection is key and has to benefit from sufficient resources. I agree that the ILO recommendation of one labour inspector per 10\xa0000 workers should be respected everywhere. We also need strong social dialogue to guarantee that enforcement. Our strategic framework has a global ambition. The EU promotes decent work across all sectors and policies in third countries and in global supply chains. On 23 February, the Commission adopted a communication on decent work worldwide. In the first half of 2023, the Commission, together with the Swedish Presidency, will organise a high level Occupational Safety and Health Summit, gathering the EU institutions, Member States, social partners, the EU-OSHA, and other relevant stakeholders. Your report represents an important contribution to the preparations of this summit. I know that Parliament gives its continued support and commitment to deliver on a healthy, safe and well-adapted work environment in Europe, and this Commission shares this commitment and will continue to work with you on its implementation. ', ' Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr\xa0President, President of the European Council, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I have pleasure in addressing you today on behalf of the President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, who is, as I am sure you are aware, in preventive self-isolation. There is a question that is on every European’s mind today: when will the pandemic finally pass? No one has the answer. The second wave has come. Infections are rising at a worrying speed again and our Member States again have to take action to contain the second wave and eventually to stop it. Since the first wave hit us, Europe has achieved a lot. Let me just name our main strands of work: vaccines, European coordination and our resilience to prevent future crises. First, progress on vaccines. We now have three contracts in place with pharmaceutical companies and three more are being finalised. This means that, if they manage to develop a vaccine, there will be doses reserved for Europeans. It also means that all Member States will get a future vaccine on the same terms and at the same time. Last week, the European Commission delivered a vaccination plan, a European framework on who should get the vaccine first. Our vaccination plan is based on science and on common sense. Health workers will take precedence. High on the list will also be people over 60, people at risk because of their health and of course essential workers, people who cannot socially distance and people who are disadvantaged because of their socioeconomic background. We want to protect these people because it’s not only a matter of social justice. We believe it’s the smartest way to ease the pressure on our health system and slow down contagion. Second, progress on European coordination. Last week, the Council adopted the Commission’s proposal on colour codes and data exchange. This means that all Member States are now speaking the same language when it comes to their citizens’ health and it means clarity for people who need to travel across the border. It is now essential to implement these decisions in full and it is also essential to agree on common rules on testing and quarantine. From Spain to Sweden, we are all facing the same disease so our precautions against it should also be the same. But we are also aware that we still have a long way to go. It will be months before a vaccine is found and distributed. We must be very disciplined and help everyone to contain the spread of the virus as much as possible in the coming weeks and months. If we fail to do so, we run the risk not only of losing the achievements in the area of health protection, but we are also risking Europe’s economic recovery, which we launched with great effort before the summer break. No one in Europe wants a second lockdown. People don’t want that and companies don’t want it either. That is why I call on European citizens to behave responsibly. Protect yourself and others. But there is also a lot at stake economically in other areas. The President of the European Council, Charles Michel, has just touched upon them, namely our negotiations with the United Kingdom and our climate target for 2030. Let me first update you on our negotiations with the UK. The deal we are trying to achieve would be absolutely unprecedented. This was the will of the EU and the UK when agreeing on the scope of the future partnership in our joint political declaration and it is still our will. No other economy is as closely aligned to ours as the British economy. It is only natural after almost 40 years as a part of the single market. UK companies produce the same products, within the same value chains, and with almost no transport costs to reach our market. We need to ensure that the European Union and the United Kingdom’s companies face fair competition on the EU market. This is why we have put so much emphasis on ensuring a level playing field and on governance and conflict resolution.  Together with fisheries, these are the main outstanding issues where we are still far apart. On each of these issues, we still have to test whether it is possible to find common ground with our British friends. This needs hard work. We have made it clear that we are ready to engage intensively to find solutions. There is no time to lose. Our objective is still to reach an agreement that will pave the way for a new fruitful relationship between the EU and the UK. We will continue to work for such an agreement, but not at any price. My good colleague and friend, Michel Barnier, will provide you with additional information on the subject. If you allow me, I will now turn to the Withdrawal Agreement, which must be fully operational as of 1 January 2021. Deal or no deal, the Withdrawal Agreement must be respected.  (Applause) It is not only a matter of trust, which is of course key, but also of political responsibility vis-à-vis our citizens and peace and stability on the island of Ireland. Therefore I welcome that, at the last Joint Committee meeting, we managed to strike a constructive approach. Now it will be vital that this translates into concrete workable operational solutions. Finally, let me say a few words on our climate ambitions. Two weeks ago, this Parliament voted for a very ambitious recommendation. The European Council has not yet reached an agreement on targets and percentages but, rest assured, the Commission will continue to push for Europe’s Heads of State and Government to unite behind an ambitious climate objective of at least 55% by 2030 and this agreement must come before the end of the year.  Last week, we presented two more stepping stones to pave the way towards 55%, the renovation wave and the methane strategy. Our next steps will include revision of the Emissions Trading System, the strategy for offshore wind, the revised regulation for the trans-European energy networks, the mobility strategy and the new proposal for the circular economy. We have a plan that can lead us to 55% and, thanks to Next Generation EU, we have the resources to turn it into reality. We know how we can achieve this goal, but it is also important to remind ourselves why we are doing it. We are going for at least 55% because this is the only way to contain global warming. We made a commitment in Paris and we want to keep our word, but we are also doing this because it makes sense economically. If we go for at least 55%, it will strengthen our first-mover advantage in clean technologies. Our companies will be the leaders in tomorrow’s markets. We will become less dependent on energy imports from the rest of the world. As we work here in Europe, they are also engaging on the global stage so that other countries match our ambition. Europe wants to lead the way and today many others are following our example but never forget that in the near future companies will compete on international markets based on who has the best green technologies. We have to increase the pace of green innovation to remain competitive. It is the right thing to do and the smartest choice as well. Fifty—five percent is an insurance on Europe’s future. I have to repeat and underline that it’s decision time. Europe must be ambitious for our planet, for our economy and for our next generation.']"
6,20,6_the_and_of_iran,"['the', 'and', 'of', 'iran', 'to', 'in', 'we', 'that', 'human', 'is']","['on behalf of the S&D Group. – Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, to take innocent people hostage by arbitrarily detaining them and threatening them with execution is unacceptable, a violation of all kinds of rules and bases of international law. It is evident that the EU Member States, at this moment, unfortunately, do not have enough leverage to combat this practice. We cannot let ourselves be put in a situation where we pay large sums, or release terrorists, or become silent because of a lack of a strategy on countering hostage taking and blackmailing. We have all witnessed how the oppressive regimes, such as the one in Iran and others, use hostages as diplomatic tools. While some European citizens have been released through lengthy negotiations – which is important, of course, and which saved lives – our Member States, however, lack the leverage to effectively combat hostage diplomacy. I have myself recently met with a lot of the family members of hostages taken in Iran and learned about the unbelievable human suffering that the Iranians’ hostage diplomacy causes. To be silent and continue with the status quo cannot and must never be an option for us in the European Union, because these horrendous regimes are bullies: when they know that one certain behaviour is successful for them, they continue to practice the same. But I also want to say that I do believe that one of the core problems is also the lack of a joint EU foreign policy in some fields. The only way the EU can really become stronger in that, against the oppressing regimes, is when the latter know that the EU is not talking with 27 different votes on foreign policies, but rather with a joint one. Nevertheless, the EU must respond against authoritarian regimes that are using innocent human beings as a means to pressure our freedoms and human rights. I therefore think it is essential that we have a European strategy to counter hostage diplomacy and improve our cooperation to release all EU citizens and to ensure that the regimes cannot continue using this hostage diplomacy as a tool over and over again. It is only when we have a real and clear strategy jointly, and we act in cooperation with each other, that we can ensure that hostage diplomacy belongs to the past and is not used in the future.', ' Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Madam\xa0President, this exchange of views has been very informative and I thank the House for the opportunity to know more about your views on this difficult issue, namely relations with Iran. I can assure you that we will not ignore the plight of the thousands of individuals in Iran who were involved in, or affected by, the protests. I confirm our commitment to address these issues with Iran, publicly and privately, until we’ve got clarity on the full scale of what has occurred and with the expectation that those identified as responsible for the violence will be held accountable. This is in general terms. I will try to answer some of the specific issues that you have raised. It has been asserted that support for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) has prevented the European Union from focusing on other issues. That’s not true. We have engaged in a frank and active dialogue with Iran on all issues, maintaining a range of EU autonomous restrictive measures, including on human rights violations.  We don’t believe that we would be in a better situation to address those without the JCPOA being in place. I can assure you that this is my strong belief. The JCPOA was first enshrined by a United Nations Security Council resolution and was not an invention by Europeans. It was the United Nations Security Council which adopted this agreement and we view it as a crucial issue for regional and European security. No one wants to see a nuclear arms race in the region and no one has been able to come up with a peaceful way of ensuring that Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon.  Having said this, we have on several occasions since June 2019 expressed our strong concern about Iran’s reduction in its commitment and we will continue defending the objective and full obligation of this agreement. We will do our best in order to save the JCPOA Agreement. Other people say that we are too soft on Iran. I want to engage with you in a frank and deep debate, and not to say that everybody is happy. No. Let’s go to the real issues. Are we too soft on Iran? I don’t think so. The EU still has a number of sanctions in place: first, nuclear proliferation sanctions under the CPOA; second, human rights sanctions – currently 83 individuals and entities, including a ban on exports to Iran of equipment which might be used for internal repression and equipment to monitor telecommunications because, when you disturb the traffic on the internet, you do that with sophisticated telecom instruments – and, third, sanctions under our Syria and CP931 terrorist regime.  So we are not being especially soft or hard. We do what we have to do and personally I think that you will understand that the JCPOA is something that is important for us, but it doesn’t prevent us from taking a tough position when such things as the ones we have seen in Iran happen. It is the case for additional human rights listing in response to the protest. To tell the truth, there are currently no proposals for additional listing on the table.  Having said that, the process for the annual review of the human rights regime is ongoing. As things stand, we still have human rights sanctions in place, as I told you, which affect 83 individuals and entities in Iran. This is a difficult question and we will continue working on it, at the same time using our diplomatic capacity in order to save a deal that is very important for our security and, on the other hand, defending human rights in Iran and elsewhere with our sanctions regime, our diplomatic pressure and our permanent claim to respect human rights.  This has been a very intensive part-session. It was my first part-session, ‘mon baptême de feu’. I would like to thank all of you for all your contributions and for your support. I know that not everybody sees things in the same way. From the left to the right, there are different approaches and different understandings of what’s happening in this difficult world in which we have to live. Today, having covered four difficult issues, thank you all for your contribution and thank you for your support for my job.  (Applause)', 'author. – Mr\xa0President, in 2021, at least 275 people were executed in Iran, including two child offenders and 10 women. In Iran, the death penalty is used as a political tool that not only punishes those who have been sentenced to capital punishment, but also those who advocate for its abolition. It’s the case of Narges\xa0Mohammadi, who has recently been sentenced to another eight years in prison, or Nasrin\xa0Sotoudeh, the recipient of the Sakharov Prize in 2012, who was sentenced to 33\xa0years and six months in prison in 2019. I would like also to stress that we continue to ask for the freedom of Djalali, as this Parliament already recalled in the past. Today, we call again on Iran to fulfil its international obligations by abolishing the death penalty and implementing its human rights commitments. We also urge the immediate release for all unjustly jailed human rights defenders. As we speak, crucial negotiations are undergoing in Vienna to revive the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Even if the scope of these talks do not include a dialogue on the situation of human rights in Iran, the two are deeply interlinked. A successful negotiation of the JCPOA will provide the basis for the peace and development needed for a more stable country that over time improves the prospects for all Iranian citizens who, we shouldn’t forget, have been the most affected by COVID and the economic sanctions. We need more dialogue with Iran, not less. The EU and other actors have already adopted a number of sanctions against individuals and entities responsible for human rights violations in Iran. Exercising further pressure has to go hand in hand with general political engagement, as some groups in this Parliament are advocating for. And this will, in a certain moment, help us as well to improve the situation of human rights in the country. The EU should continue to monitor and raise human rights matters in the context of the EU—Iran high—level dialogue and reiterate that respect for human rights is a core component in advancement of EU—Iran relations. It is in our interest to support the talks, to return to the JCPOA, also to have more leverage to improve the human rights situation in the country.']"
7,19,7_and_of_the_to,"['and', 'of', 'the', 'to', 'rights', 'in', 'women', 'equality', 'that', 'is']","[' President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam\xa0President, the rights of women and girls and gender equality have been the main cross-cutting priority of the Finnish Presidency in the field of development cooperation, following a rights-based approach to development including sexual and reproductive health and rights. We are serious about our joint commitment, under the European consensus on development and sustainable development goals, to work with partners to eliminate all forms of sexual and gender-based violence and discrimination, including harmful practices such as, in particular, female genital mutilation. The EU and its Member States have long demonstrated strong commitment and leadership at multilateral level in promoting the rights of women and girls and gender equality. The Joint EU-UN spotlight initiative to eliminate violence against women and girls is an exemplary case in point, an unprecedented global effort to invest in gender equality and women’s empowerment as a precondition and driver for the achievement of the sustainable development goals. In Africa, the spotlight initiative is addressing sexual and gender-based violence, child marriage, female genital mutilation and their linkages to sexual and reproductive health access. The recent International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD +25) Summit, co-hosted by Denmark, Kenya and the UN Population Fund in Nairobi, was extremely successful. Extensive financial pledges were made from both public and private sources, as well as political commitments, notably a reaffirmation of efforts to achieve zero female genital mutilation by 2030, in line with our commitment under the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. Our achievements and leadership are real, but we must continue pushing until we have lived up to our commitment to achieve the objective of zero harmful practices against women and girls. The UN has named 6\xa0February as the international day of zero tolerance for female genital mutilation, and around that day, the European Commission will take stock, as every year, of EU efforts in this field. We look forward to this report. We would also look with keen interest at the proposal from the Commission to renew the EU’s strategic engagement for gender equality that will be expiring at the end of this month. This should, hopefully, include an EU strategy to end female genital mutilation around the world once and for all. Before concluding, let me recall that, unfortunately, a significant number of women in the EU live with the lifelong consequences of female genital mutilation or are at risk of it. Without dismissing our achievements, therefore, we are aware of the need to do more in Europe with respect to the implementation of national laws, specialised support services, or enhancing multidisciplinary actions with affected communities. But I am convinced that, by continuing to work together, we will be able to secure further achievements in Europe and globally. Thank you very much for this very important discussion.', ' Member of the Commission. – Mr\xa0President, our commitment to support human\xa0rights defenders, including women’s rights defenders, is a fundamental part of our human\xa0rights policy. Unfortunately, in too many countries, including Iran, women continue to face threats and abuse because they are human\xa0rights defenders or simply because they are women. They receive defamatory comments and slander. They face hatred, harassment, intimidation and incitement to violence, often of a sexual nature, or they face imprisonment for standing up for their basic rights. In this context, I would like to express how deeply saddened I am by the fate of Sahar Khodayari, who earlier this month set herself on fire after learning that she faced a prison sentence for trying to attend a football match, and who died in the hospital from her wounds. Her tragic death is the heart-breaking aftermath of an appalling contempt for women’s rights. No woman should fear imprisonment for attending a sporting event.  Every year, on 8\xa0May, the international community marks International Women’s Day. For the European Union, this is a time to pay tribute to acts of courage and determination by ordinary women around the world who have played an extraordinary role in the history of their countries and communities. In the joint statement that the EU published on 8\xa0May this year, we stated that we are committed to giving all women and girls equal access to health services, education and economic empowerment and opportunities to shape their own future. We will never stop fighting for true equality for all, inside and outside the European Union, to make sure that progress achieved is not undone. Our commitment to support human\xa0rights defenders, including women’s rights defenders, also applies to our work in Iran. In the context of the regular, high-level political dialogue with Iran that aims to advance bilateral cooperation in a number of areas of mutual interest, the European Union has been consistently raising issues of human rights. We have regularly engaged with the authorities to demand that human\xa0rights defenders, including women, must not be subjected to harassment or detention.  We have been vocal in this demand, for instance in the case of the 2012 Sakharov Prize laureate Nasrin Sotoudeh, who was sentenced to long periods of imprisonment because of her advocacy for fundamental human rights. And we continue to be vocal, including in international fora such as the United Nations Human Rights Council. The rights of women and girls are also likely to figure prominently during Iran’s upcoming Universal Periodic Review in November. I am acutely aware that the focus of this debate also extends to the situation of EU dual nationals imprisoned in Iran. There again I would like to be clear: the practice of detaining and imprisoning individuals, such as the UK Iranian citizen Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, solely on account of their nationality is contrary to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Iran has ratified and is bound to uphold. Iran’s continued practice of detaining dual nationals clearly breaches the commitment that no\xa0one shall be subject to arbitrary arrest or detention. As the European Union, we will continue to call for the release of all EU-Iranian dual nationals and all Iranian human\xa0rights defenders. We also call on Iran to ensure that no individual is detained arbitrarily, and that detainees are not subject to any form of mistreatment. Detainees should also have timely access to a lawyer of their own choosing, and to adequate medical care. Honourable Members, thank you for this debate. I can tell you that we are encouraged by the attention paid to these issues by the Members of the European Parliament and we will continue our efforts to work together with you to support human\xa0rights defenders across the world. (Applause)', ' Member of the Commission. – Madam\xa0President, I thank the European Parliament for putting this important topic on the agenda today. I also thank the Finnish Government for their commitment towards gender equality. This is a subject that is very close to my heart and I am committed to doing everything within my power to eliminate this scourge, this suffering which millions of girls and women are made to endure, even now as we speak. It is essential that we expose and combat this severe violation of human rights, women’s rights and children’s rights.  The EU and the United Nations programme to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, with an investment of EUR\xa0100 million, is the Spotlight Initiative, as was already mentioned. With this project, the scope is to leave no girl, no woman behind. The current EU projects in several African countries and the support the EU gave to the UNICEF programme on abandonment of female genital mutilation (FGM) have reached more than 1.5 million women, who received services for protection and care related to FGM. This programme also galvanised civic movement through the encouragement of more than 3\xa0000 communities, representing 8.5 million individuals, to make a public declaration of abandonment.  We know that FGM exists also within the European Union. Estimates show that at least half a million girls and women who have suffered from genital mutilation live in Europe. The European Institute for Gender Equality plays a leading role in providing information and research on female genital mutilation in the EU. In all our Member States, FGM is a crime. The efforts to combat it and support its victims are also integrated in EU legislation, notably the Victims’ Rights Directive. The issue is covered in EU asylum legislation.  The Commission continues to provide funding through the DAPHNE strand of the EU programmes for projects aimed at combating gender-based violence, including FGM. The next call for proposals will open in early 2020 with an indicative budget of EUR\xa012.4 million.  Honourable Members, we need to do more to make sure that the predictions of another estimated 200 million FGM victims by 2030 will not materialise. President von der Leyen’s Agenda for Europe has put the prevention of gender-based violence and the protection of victims at the heart of the Union’s equality policy for these five years. I am fully committed to the fight against gender-based violence and I am sure I can count on the support of the European Parliament on this matter.  The forthcoming robust gender equality strategy, which we will adopt in 2020, will address violence against women directly through various measures, including those addressing FGM. It is important to work on different areas at the same time and to tackle the issue from different angles and across the portfolios. I believe we can continue to work on the five priority areas outlined in the 2013 Commission communication on ending female genital mutilation, that is: improving knowledge and data, supporting sustainable social change, protection, prosecution and combating FGM worldwide.  Women’s rights are indeed at the core of EU foreign policy, and this includes the fight against FGM. We need to work with our international partners across the world to support the implementation of the UN sustainable development goals, which cover violence against women. The European Parliament has an important role to play through its political networks around the world. We have to acknowledge that FGM is a sensitive matter to tackle. It encompasses a variety of areas, from general human rights to women’s right to bodily integrity, the tackling of gender-based violence and the right to health. This is why it is important that we work together with FGM survivors, FGM practicing communities and experts in an empowering manner, free of misunderstandings and misconceptions. We must avoid stigmatisation, racism and xenophobia at all costs. We should instead promote empowerment, cooperation and dialogue. Apart from funding and legislation, we must include all stakeholders at all levels, from our political dialogues with national administrations, to our support for health care professionals, religious and community leaders, and families in eradicating female genital mutilation once and for all. I look forward to your views today, and to working with you towards this mandate on this very important issue. ']"

Are we going to just keep kicking this down the road? We cannot keep delaying. We have all been bombarded from the Indian lobby; we have been bombarded from various parts of the Parliament here. As my colleague just said, we cannot stand here and commemorate 75 years of the Holocaust. This started with hate speech, this started with the death of empathy, this started with incitement – and all that it takes for evil to triumph is that good people do nothing. We cannot keep postponing. So I vote very strongly against and I hope that everyone will be vigilant and not hypocritical, that they deliver on this today. No more delays.', 'Thank you, Ms\xa0Pereira. Now for this specific debate, we accepted all blue—cards and all the catch—the—eye requests, I believe maybe we had a record today, but it’s a most important and lively debate and it’s well—deserved as we discuss the future of Europe. I really want to thank our Vice—President, Ms\xa0Dubravka\xa0Šuica, for staying and listening to the whole debate in the European Parliament from so many colleagues staying with us, and also our Vice—President, Mr\xa0Margaritis\xa0Schinas, who also stayed and followed all the debate. I have received also three motions for resolutions to wind up this debate and now the debate is closed.  The vote will be held tomorrow.  Thank you colleagues, we may proceed to the next item.

I would like to say that in this House of democracy, please refer to people by their group name, do not look at this side of the Parliament and call us ‘far right’. I am not a far-right politician! I agree with Ms\xa0Iratxe that we need to find coherent agreement, that’s why we’re here, do not call me far right, do not call us far right. It is respect. This is also for you, Mr\xa0Weber.

Particularly at a time of serious geopolitical challenges, a stable and trustful cooperation is crucial. For this reason, like many other colleagues, I welcome the Windsor framework that was announced on 27 February. This is a welcome and long-awaited step in the right direction which should allow us to open a new chapter in our relationship. Let me congratulate Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. The agreement shows that practical and shared solutions to the challenges in the implementation of the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland can be found. It highlights that joint efforts to find bilateral solutions to mitigate the consequences of Brexit can ensure stability and predictability for people and businesses in Northern Ireland, while at the same time maintaining the integrity of our EU single market. The Windsor framework also reflects the EU’s long-standing commitment to protect the Belfast Good Friday Agreement in all its parts. The timely implementation of the solutions identified in the Windsor framework is key now. As the European Parliament, we will deliver on the legislative procedures as quickly as possible. Let me also thank Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič and his team for the great work and for the excellent cooperation with Parliament. You can count on our continued support.', 'on behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam\xa0President, we have come a long way, but now is the time to close the deal. History will be harsh on both the European Union and the United Kingdom if we fail on the ultimate stretch.  My group, the ECR, wants a deal. We have always been very close to the British, in particular the Conservative Party. British Conservatives were co—founders of our group. They offered us professionalism, pragmatism and a sense of humour. In the Conservative Party an understatement is an expression of survival, since your opponent within is never far away – basically behind you! However, that party also produced historic leaders like Winston\xa0Churchill and Margaret\xa0Thatcher with the power of strong personalities.  Since the British have left, the European Parliament has become more boring, if I may say, and without Nigel\xa0Farage over there in the corner, rather quiet, like a provincial assembly. But Mr\xa0Farage has found other topics to play the naughty boy of Britain. Without the British, the right to dissent seems to disappear from this Parliament, unfortunately. There is mounting pressure for la pensée unique. Open debate and conflicting arguments, however, are ways to test ideas against reality. Too many narratives in this Chamber remain in a void of self—complacency, missing the much—needed reality check. Without the British, the European Parliament tends to become a kind of religious congregation mainly convinced of itself.  We have to look for ways to keep these qualities the British have brought to this Parliament in which, ironically, English remains the main language of communication without interpretation.  The Brexit negotiations have also shown cultural differences. The French always have une logique and a big design; the British rather proceed case by case, picking the cases that serve them best, as Mr Barnier may have noticed.  I thank Mr Barnier, Mr Šefčovič and Mr Frost, including their teams, for all the efforts to find common ground from different positions. Madam President, we have to close the deal, but Parliament should not resort to grandstanding. Regarding a possible agreement it’s simply ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Political groups should work on a resolution for debate here in Brussels. The vote could be carried out remotely – a useful practicality we have mastered in this eventful year. Let us establish an EP—UK parliamentary delegation to remain in dialogue and to meet old friends in a new era.', 'rapporteur. – Mr President, dear colleagues, yesterday, during the State of the Union, we listened to President von der Leyen speak about transformation and reform. But the loudest part of yesterday’s speech was the one that we didn’t hear, the one about citizens and democracy. One could say it was more like a State of the European Union bubble. It was a discussion between us, more Brussels people and Strasbourg people. In order to transform the State of the Union we need to bring closer to the Union the citizens. And this is precisely the core objective of this report: to find ways of upgrading our European democracy and bringing the EU closer to its people. Indeed, our European democracy has been described by scholars in many ways, but actually few are positive. When people talk about the EU and its processes, they often think about ‘deficit’, ‘bureaucracy’, ‘impersonal’, ‘elitist’ or ‘something far away’. We even invented nice words to cover, I would say, our weaknesses, such as ‘failing forward’ or ‘sui generis model’. While I’m the first to defend the EU, I’m also the first to point out to its weaknesses, because, yes, the EU is not perfect. The EU’s institutional architecture is not fit for the 21st century, and we must admit that. We still think in terms of unanimity and we allow singular governments to take over the EU agenda for selfish national interests. The system in place is one in which one Member State can decide for 26. Unanimity does not strengthen our weakest members, but it weakens us all. Every day you come to work in this House and we vote on laws, but we cannot initiate them. This is not how a real democracy works. So what we say in this report is that we should make the necessary changes so that the EU becomes a fully fledged democracy on its own account: not a sui generis democracy, not something that falls forward just as a matter of gravity or inertia. To achieve this, we need to put Parliament at the centre of our democracy system. We need to become an authentic, bicameral parliamentary system in which the Council becomes a genuine upper chamber. And very importantly, we must put an end to the practice of the European Council tasking the Commission or even the Parliament to do this or that. The Commission and the Parliament are not the Secretariat of the European Council. On top of that, we must bring freshness in our European democracy. And I would say we need freshness in democracy in general. Because we not we have not refreshed and upgraded our democracy model for more than 150 years. We are no longer in the 1800s. Citizens are not engaged in our democratic life because they feel that their voice is not heard. It’s not me who says that, but it’s almost every Eurobarometer. This is why what we propose is to empower the citizens to actively contribute to the democratic life of the Union. And not only every five years when we have elections, but every year. And for that reason, we propose to create the European Agora, which would empower the citizens to be more active in our democratic life.']"

There will, of course, be an evaluation. So, of course, the Commission will come back to Parliament when we have that assessment in due course.  On the second question, when you look at the Horizon Europe provisions, we have an article, I think it’s 22.5, which allows us to close certain calls for entities where we think that there might be a risk. And so far, when you look at emerging technologies, that could be, for instance, quantum, I think no Chinese or Chinese control directly or indirectly have been part of those calls. The Chinese are, I think, world-leading when it comes to quantum. Europe is also very far ahead. But because of that, we found that it’s important that funding in specific strategic sectors goes to entities where we know for sure that we can vouch for how they are working with it. So I think that is a good example of how we have a general provision that can be used specifically on different areas where we find that things may be at risk. These are few areas, because the openness of research also increases the level and the resilience of the research community. But there are areas where it is important to say ‘thank you but no thank you’ to entities participating in the calls.', ' – Madam\xa0President, the dispute settlement mechanism of the World Trade Organization was a milestone in multilateral trade negotiations in 1995. The mechanism has adjudicated hundreds of cases between member countries (and Bernd mentioned it), including more than 120 brought by the United States against trade-distorting measures of other nations. It has helped to strengthen the rules-based international legal order with, by the way, the United States as one of its major beneficiaries. Today, this legal order is under threat. The veto of the US administration – and it did not start with Trump, it started already with Obama – appointing any new judges to the Appellate Body will effectively block its capability to resolve disputes. Of course, we recognise the legitimate concerns of our American partners: it is true that the Appellate Body must not overstep its mandate. But disabling it through obstruction is short sighted. For that reason I call on the Commission to intensify its engagement in order to unblock the appointments procedure as a matter of priority, like we should do in this House. History is full of examples of trade disputes escalating into armed conflict. Trade wars led to real wars. Let us today unite in support of the rules-based trading order in support of the WTO. I’m very happy that even the Greens now fight for the WTO, which you did not for so many years; you should have done earlier and in support of this motion.', ' – Mr President, High Representative, I welcome the broad emphasis of the third progress report. A greater unity in the EU on foreign matters is essential, because that will lead us to be on equal footing with other global powers. But there are many challenges ahead of us, which you have clearly outlined. Yes, we need more cooperation on security matters, but we also have a real job of work to do in terms of protecting multilateralism. Reforming the international organisation system is key, but for me, above all, sustainable development really has to be part of this strategy – and it is a security issue.  It is also of the utmost importance in terms of global strategy that the EU looks beyond Europe much more in this mandate, especially at China, which is a serious threat to multilateralism and is being more and more aggressive on the global stage in Africa, in the Pacific and elsewhere, as the US is retreating from international organisation. It really is important that we look at this. At the same time, we need to involve, India, Japan, Canada, Australia, much more in our focus, because they are defenders of multilateralism and they share our values. I will submit my question to you in writing. ']"
