        "speech": " Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, let me start by expressing my sincere gratitude to this House for the hard work that went into the highly technical and very important report we are discussing this evening and which you will vote on tomorrow. I would like to thank the ENVI Committee and especially the rapporteur, Mr Hojsík and all shadow rapporteurs for an extremely thorough and timely report.  We need to remember that this legislative revision will be instrumental in helping us attain the objectives of the European Green Deal. It is fully in line with the zero pollution action plan, the chemical strategy for sustainability and the circular economy action plan. It also implements our international obligations under the Stockholm Convention and, of course, it ensures the environmentally sound management of waste which contains persistent organic pollutants toxic to the environment and to human health.  We very much appreciate your efforts to find the best approach to minimise emissions of persistent organic pollutants from waste and to promote the uptake of safe secondary materials.  Looking at the amendments you propose, I see that our objectives are clearly aligned. I also note that you would like to go further and faster on the limit values to be set in waste for most of the substances in scope. I also take note of your request to the Commission to equate the concept of the persistent organic pollutants waste with that of hazardous waste in the review of EU waste legislation, and of your proposal to list an additional family of these substances constituted by perfluorohexane sulfonic acid and its components.  Setting these limits is a delicate exercise. We need to consider both our obligation and our very legitimate desire to reduce the presence of these substances to a minimum, but also technical feasibility and proportionality. The interplay with Green Deal objectives such as climate neutrality and the ambition for a more circular economy are also very important and need to be taken into account.  All these points will require further discussion in the coming weeks and months. Some of them will depend on the decision to be taken in the forthcoming Conference of the parties to the Stockholm Convention about the listing.  Thanks to the swift and efficient work on this complex file in the ENVI Committee, it has been possible to build broad support for your mandate, little more than five months after the Commission adopted its proposal. This is truly remarkable, bringing us to where we are today with trilogues scheduled to commence in less than two weeks.  The legislative proposal to amend the waste annexes of the Persistent Organic Pollutants Regulation was one of the first deliverables the Commission proposed under the circular economy action plan. It may also be the first to be adopted, with a political agreement in sight before the end of June.  And I sincerely hope we can achieve that. And I can assure you that we can count on your sustained support and you can count on the Commission’s constructive support during the negotiations.",

We have witnessed destructive wiper attacks on hundreds of systems in the Ukrainian Government from IT, energy, financial organisations, nuclear plants, telecommunications to broadcasting companies. During the conflict, malicious cyberattacks have been a prominent component of Russian cyber operations, strongly correlated and sometimes directly timed with kinetic military operations, targeting services and institutions which are crucial for civilians, whether it is to steal data from nuclear plants or to cause chaotic disinformation in the environment, disrupting citizens’ access to reliable information and critical life services, shaking confidence in the country’s leadership.  All these cyberattacks are sparking concerns of more significant consequences and catastrophic effects that could also affect and target directly our European Union, our Member States. Every Member State, every EU organisation, large or small, must be prepared to respond to these disruptive incidents. Being prepared will ultimately protect civilians from attacks that can directly affect their lives and access to critical, important services. ",

We all know that Emily O’Reilly has done an excellent job and I congratulate her on her re—election. However, this election has shown that there are some procedural problems. It will be our task in the Committee on Petitions to change or clarify the election procedure for the next term. It should be in line with the principles that the Ombudsman stands for: clear, transparent and fair. There should be rules on campaigning for, as we all know, this campaign, unfortunately, was kind of dirty sometimes, and we of course need a very clear timeframe so as not to put those candidates who are acting according to the rules into a vulnerable position in comparison with others. After the adoption of this report tomorrow, we also need a vision for the future. I agree with what was said by my colleagues from the PPE and S&D Groups, but I would like to highlight another thing. There are still things which have to be done regarding good administration in EU institutions, and the procedure behind Commission responses is one of them. When we send citizens’ complaints about Member States and possible infringements to the Commission, the Commission asks the national authorities about this. They ask the possible infringer whether they are breaking EU law, and the answer is of course always, ‘no’. What is interesting is that the Commission is normally satisfied with this answer and we receive answers from the Commission saying that there is no problem and no infringement. This means that we are not standing on the side of the citizen who is complaining and who is in an unequal battle with European bureaucracy. This needs to be changed. The same applies to the ‘EU Pilot’ where we can submit individual complaints about possible infringements. The process is not transparent. The documents of closed files are not openly available and getting them is a big problem. I would like to see a more proactive and more transparent approach, and of course I look forward to cooperating with the Ombudsman further and hopefully to solving this problem. ",

However, given its nature of interinstitutional agreement, with the timelines needed for such an act, there is an important necessity to use all our means to prevent such cases of corruption or misconduct from being repeated.  President Metsola’s package is a good start but we can and we must do more. I am thinking, for example, about the need to clearly define conflict of interest and strictly regulate the phenomenon of the revolving doors to ensure transparency on the decision-making for our Parliament in the Bureau as well as in the CoP.  There is an issue that I believe we must immediately fix to build a more democratic and accountable Europe. In 2019, the EU finally adopted a dedicated and comprehensive directive on whistle-blower protection, which does not include the staff members of the EU institutions, agencies and bodies. Speaking up is one of the hardest acts a person can do. It requires immense courage and sacrifice. We must encourage our whistle-blowers and we must protect them in the moment in which they will denounce.",

The question is now what can we expect from the TTC? We know it will deal with trade and technology, so that takes care of the two Ts. But the essence of what we can expect can be described best by using words starting with the letter C, so we can expect that the TTC will be a forum where we can converse and collaborate, where we can minimise conflict, where we can compare and converge approaches, where we can reach compromises and aim for consensus – where we can find a way to deal with China, even though we avoid using the name. But if I were to choose one word starting with the letter C to describe what a successful overall outcome would be of the TTC for the transatlantic relationship, I would choose the word ‘compatibility’.

Or can I even call them conclusions, because the only thing that leaders could agree on was that they had actually talked about climate. We are in the midst of a rapidly progressing climate crisis and postponement of action is a mistake. This year again looks set to break any sort of records with regard to climate crisis, be it heat waves, droughts, intensity, extreme weather events, Arctic shield loss, etc.  So, let me be very clear. Deciding to talk about climate later is failing to grasp the urgency of this task. We have to act now and we have to act decisively at all levels and also in all policy areas, and the compromise reached by the European Parliament on reducing greenhouse gases by 60% by 2030 is a good step forward. Some of you have said it’s an ambitious target, but it’s not so ambitious: it’s a more realistic target if we really want to save our planet. Member States should sign up to it quickly – to the 60% goal – so we can finally start acting. The climate doesn’t wait and neither should we.  And yes, the economic transformation needed for that is no walk in the park, especially for regions with a long-standing tradition of carbon-intensive economies. That’s why the Parliament is insisting on having a proper-sized Just Transition Fund, among others, as part of a new EU budget, because you need to put the money where your policy targets is. You need to put the money where you want to have the EU fit for the tasks ahead and that requires adequate funding. Any government should know that. We need to have a climate spending target of 30% and a biodiversity target of 10% in order to be up to the tasks ahead. And EU funds also need to advance our Union values. That’s why compliance with rule of law must be an essential criteria for allocating the funds and these are critical elements in the Parliament’s position on the EU budget and recovery fund. It is just inadmissible that the Council disregards such fundamental concerns.  As for Brexit, it’s very sad to see that so much time has passed without any agreement being reached on our future relations. We’re approaching the end of the time limit and I just want to remind us that of course the UK Government could have asked for an extension and they decided not to, but it’s also clear that we cannot accept a deal that would endanger the single market, social rights or environmental standards. So further work is needed on that and we are still extremely sad that Brexit was decided, but now we need to see that we also ensure the Union’s togetherness. We are again holding this meeting under very exceptional circumstances. We’re in the midst of a big, big medical crisis. Let us learn from the EU response in the spring, let us now be more coordinated, more cohesive and make sure that border restrictions are avoided. It’s an exceptional year in many different ways and the Council needs to step up if it is ready to face these challenges. (Applause)",

        "speech": " Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, Madam Vedrenne, who is here in lieu of the rapporteur, first, I want to welcome this report and I would like to express my personal gratitude for this very valuable work.  Traineeships are an important pathway for young people to enter the labour market and gain practical experience but first they need to be quality traineeships and second they cannot be for free.  Young people have been vocal about this issue, which also came out of the Conference on the Future of Europe. Many young people, you have mentioned it, have suffered from the impact of COVID-19, and many continue to suffer from the increasing cost of living. Young people deserve our respect and their commitment deserves our recognition.  In 2020, we pledged in our youth employment support package to step up EU support to increase youth employment, notably reinforcing the Youth Guarantee, which has helped over 50 million young people since 2013. This package also included a modernised European framework for vocational education and training and a renewed impetus for apprenticeships.  We need to keep working towards the EU targets set in the European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan of 78 % employment rates and also to reduce the rate of young people not in employment, educational training, which is currently at 11.7 %. Quality traineeships can contribute to achieving these targets and we fully agree with Parliament’s political objective to improve their quality and inclusiveness.  A recent Eurobarometer survey on traineeships showed, for example, that almost 70 % of trainees managed to find a job following their traineeship. However, there is equally room for improvement and I therefore welcome the draft resolution.  Vulnerable groups, including those with disabilities, should have equal opportunities in doing a traineeship, regardless of their background. We also agree that trainees should be treated fairly for the work that they do, and we cannot allow, under no circumstances, that traineeships are misused to replace regular jobs, and very often not paid.  This is why in the follow up on the Year of Youth, and as part of the Year of Skills, the 2023 Commission work programme includes an initiative to update the current quality framework for traineeships. The Commission work programme is also clear in stating that we want to address issues like fair remuneration and social protection.  I thank the Parliament for its valuable contribution, in particular for the additional quality principles both regarding the social rights of trainees and the learning content of traineeships. I also take note of the European Parliament’s request for legislative action.  I confirm that in line with the commitment by President von der Leyen, the Commission will respond with a legislative act in full respect of the proportionality, subsidiarity and better law-making principles. In doing so, we will of course, consult the European social partners who may decide to engage negotiations and that act by means of agreements.  The Commission will do its utmost to take into account the elements raised in the resolution, while fully respecting – we are obliged to do so – legal boundaries set by the Treaties. We will also ensure not to weaken the existing legal acquis; the draft motion and its annexes currently contain elements which indeed require an in-depth analysis.  We will also take into account the impacts on small- and medium-sized enterprises. The report calls for revision of the equality acquis here. We strongly believe that independent and empowered equality bodies will strengthen the effectiveness and enforcement of the Employment Equality Directive.  We will uphold our commitments made in 22 European Year of Youth and the European Year of Skills and in the Conference on the Future of Europe. And we will uphold our commitment to you to respond to every legislative own initiative report.  We need to put in place the necessary policy, regulatory and financial measures to provide young people with the opportunities and instruments they need to succeed in their life. Their talents and innovation capacity cannot be used for free. This is also an issue for social responsibility of companies.  Investing in young people is key to build a strong human capital and to ensure the prosperity, fairness and competitiveness of the European Union. We all share the objective of empowering our young generation. Let me again express my sincere gratitude for your valuable report. ",

We all wring our hands and say ‘Oh God, isn’t it desperate’. But we never joined the dots. We never ask enough about why are people poor and hungry, and what role did we play in making them so. Because it’s not a random act of God. These are the consequences of our actions. Sustainable development is an impossibility against the backdrop of unfettered growth, against the backdrop of an economic system which puts profit before people.  We talk about peace as being a goal. Well, let’s look at Afghanistan – a country where 47% of the 42 million population is under 15 years old, 15.2 million children are in need of humanitarian assistance and 2.3 million face acute malnutrition. And this after 40 years of conflict, a third year of drought and sanctions. If we want sustainable development, we could start by butting out of these countries!",

From EU money buying up fishing rights from poor African countries – calling it aid spending as a cover to hoover up their fishing resources – to a common fisheries policy which has seen fishers in countries like Ireland utterly devastated: our record really isn’t a good one. Whether it’s the failure to compensate people like C.J. Gaffney for the decommissioning of the Mary Kate – a campaign still going on – or the fact that small fishers have been pauperised and virtually eliminated in Ireland. From having 20% of EU waters when we joined, getting only 4% of the catch, we now even import certain categories of fish. This obviously needs urgent action. Throughout the world we see entire fishing regions depleted to vanishing point and our policies are part of the problem. We need a sustainable approach that respects scientific evidence regarding conservation, and fishing communities involved rather than always pandering to the big boy.",

        "speech": " President of the Commission. – Madam President, thank you very much for the replies and the discussion that we have started here together. As you know, with the State of the Union, it is not only the speech to be delivered, but there is a letter of intent that I have put forward and there are a limited number also of additional initiatives. Let me address some of them that have been mentioned here. My first point is on the topic of the rule of law. The rule of law is the glue of our Union. And we’ve brought forward the historic NextGenerationEU package because we knew it was of paramount importance that we had to invest in the European Union. This is common European Union taxpayers’ money and, therefore, there is a strong obligation that we connect it with necessary reforms in the respective Member States. And if in Member States there are issues of the rule of law, we’ve connected it to the investment of NextGenerationEU. And it is absolutely not acceptable that a Member State wants to access the funds of NextGenerationEU without having the reforms that we have agreed upon when closing the contract for NextGenerationEU. So if you want to have taxpayers’ money as investment in your Member State, you have to abide by the rule of law and you have to do the reforms that are necessary. (Applause) Second point, on our defence capabilities. First of all, let me step one step backwards, looking at Ukraine. We all know we want peace in Ukraine, but it has to be a just peace and a lasting one. And for that, Ukraine needs security guarantees. Kyiv must be able, and have the capabilities, to deter a new Russian attack. And here Europe comes into play by ensuring Ukraine’s long-term security, which has strong implications for our defence industry. Europe’s defence industry is running at maximum speed – we know this – but it is not enough, because to empower Ukraine’s deterrence, we must step up the production of our military capabilities. And this is what we are doing with ASAP, for example, the Act in Support of Ammunition Production. And I would like to thank the European Parliament and the Council for passing it in record time. We must also look beyond this ammunition topic, to air defence, maritime, space and cyber, for example. And these capabilities are European by nature. No single Member State can alone develop them, so they require European cooperation, not only on research and development, but also on the industrial front. And this is why we will work on a European defence industry strategy to look into how we can support our industry and ramp up the production of critical equipment, of course in synergy with NATO – this is absolutely paramount. No industrial bottlenecks should prevent us from protecting Europe and giving our full support to Ukraine. And my third point I wanted to address – because it was mentioned by many of you – is the European Green Deal. Politics is always also personal. During this mandate, since 2019, I was blessed in my family to have three grandchildren. I was not a grandmother before that. And since my mandate, the experience of welcoming three little babies to this world changes also the deep conviction that you have for the future of these children. Because my perspective is a very limited one, but if I look at these children or babies, toddlers that they are, in 2030 they will be of school age. In 2050 perhaps they want to have a family and children. And now I, of course, over and over ask myself and you do the same: will they have a spring, a summer, a fall and a winter like we had when we were children? How will their future be? Will they be able to have their own family? How will the world be? And I know this is definitely linked also to how we will decide today about the European Green Deal. So what I can only say here in front of you, honourable Members, is that I am deeply, personally committed to the European Green Deal. I know it is paramount for our survival, but it is also paramount for our future prosperity – if we make it, and we can make it together if we stand united. (Applause)",

I already looked back at the achievements in my first speech, and now I think it is really important that we also look forward in this debate, that we look at the next 30 years. And we also did this with the hearing and the resolution in the IMCO Committee. So, thanks to all the colleagues who also contributed to our debates in our committee to the resolution that we are voting on tomorrow. I want to mention three points where I think we need an update of the single market, where we need to develop it further to really cope with the current challenges. First, we have to speed up the green transition. In this regard, sustainable products have to be the norm on our single market. If all product groups end up complying with minimum sustainability standards, we are making the sustainable choice a default one for the consumers, and this is what they are asking for. And this is why the European Commission needs to deliver on the promised right to repair initiative: to save money, to save energy, to protect our resources, to make our internal market a proper green market. Second, digitisation in the EU must be human—centred, based on our high democratic, data protection and sustainability standards. The Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act are ground—breaking. Digital services are shaping our lives, our democracy. But there is so much left to do to ensure that the rights and freedoms applying offline also apply online. And third, and a lot of colleagues have already mentioned this today, we need better enforcement to make legislation a reality and leverage the single market’s power also globally. European businesses deserve a level playing field with our high standards applied to imports and, in turn, European businesses will profit from European standards that will become a global yardstick. Already now, the single market’s high social and environmental, but also digital, standards spill over and shape globalisation. I am happy that we are taking this time today to debate the future of our single market.",

I am quite confident that the impact assessment that is ongoing will help us on the fine-tuning of the design of the mechanism – which is, of course, a new mechanism, on the sectors that will be involved gradually since the beginning and then enlarging in the next years, and also on the timing of the introduction of the new rules and on the phasing-out of aspects of existing rules. We know that we have a target which is 2023 in the interinstitutional agreement. So I think that we have a good basis on the fact that this issue is now on the global agenda. It was not the case one year ago. It was completely unthinkable to have some of the main trade powers discussing a carbon border mechanism or carbon tax or other things, and in this global debate the European Union has the advantage of the early movers, which is the advantage of trying to give a contribution to set new standards. I think that we will give this contribution and this will help us on this historic challenge of the climate transition.",

We are deeply concerned over the legal action initiated by authorities in Guatemala against independent judges, lawyers and prosecutors, who have been involved in investigating anti—corruption cases. More than 20 of them have already left the country out of fear for their safety. We urge the Guatemalan authorities to put an end to the criminalisation of justice operators, to ensure the independence of the justice system and to guarantee a transparent process when selecting the new Attorney General. We also see that the attacks and the criminalisation of land and environmental defenders are increasing. We Greens defend the rights of the citizens, and not of a corrupted elite who sacrifices people and natural resources for their own profit. I remember Lolita Chavez, our Sakharov Prize finalist in 2017, she warned us that ‘various EU companies are violating rights of the people in Guatemala’.  Therefore, we must call on the EU companies to apply strict due diligence to ensure human rights compliance. We should continue the constructive dialogue that we have built with Guatemala and its embassy in Brussels. In this dialogue, the EU has to promote democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law. ",

It’s not in the action plan, but we need it and I think that this Parliament is united behind that idea. Secondly, as Mr Sven Giegold has mentioned before, when we have a serious problem at Member State level of enforcing our framework against money laundering, we need infringement procedures, and it would be good, Commissioner, for you to tell us when you will start doing that.

I can assure you that we will not ignore the plight of the thousands of individuals in Iran who were involved in, or affected by, the protests. I confirm our commitment to address these issues with Iran, publicly and privately, until we’ve got clarity on the full scale of what has occurred and with the expectation that those identified as responsible for the violence will be held accountable. This is in general terms. I will try to answer some of the specific issues that you have raised. It has been asserted that support for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) has prevented the European Union from focusing on other issues. That’s not true. We have engaged in a frank and active dialogue with Iran on all issues, maintaining a range of EU autonomous restrictive measures, including on human rights violations.  We don’t believe that we would be in a better situation to address those without the JCPOA being in place. I can assure you that this is my strong belief. The JCPOA was first enshrined by a United Nations Security Council resolution and was not an invention by Europeans. It was the United Nations Security Council which adopted this agreement and we view it as a crucial issue for regional and European security. No one wants to see a nuclear arms race in the region and no one has been able to come up with a peaceful way of ensuring that Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon.  Having said this, we have on several occasions since June 2019 expressed our strong concern about Iran’s reduction in its commitment and we will continue defending the objective and full obligation of this agreement. We will do our best in order to save the JCPOA Agreement. Other people say that we are too soft on Iran. I want to engage with you in a frank and deep debate, and not to say that everybody is happy. No. Let’s go to the real issues. Are we too soft on Iran? I don’t think so. The EU still has a number of sanctions in place: first, nuclear proliferation sanctions under the CPOA; second, human rights sanctions – currently 83 individuals and entities, including a ban on exports to Iran of equipment which might be used for internal repression and equipment to monitor telecommunications because, when you disturb the traffic on the internet, you do that with sophisticated telecom instruments – and, third, sanctions under our Syria and CP931 terrorist regime.  So we are not being especially soft or hard. We do what we have to do and personally I think that you will understand that the JCPOA is something that is important for us, but it doesn’t prevent us from taking a tough position when such things as the ones we have seen in Iran happen. It is the case for additional human rights listing in response to the protest. To tell the truth, there are currently no proposals for additional listing on the table.  Having said that, the process for the annual review of the human rights regime is ongoing. As things stand, we still have human rights sanctions in place, as I told you, which affect 83 individuals and entities in Iran. This is a difficult question and we will continue working on it, at the same time using our diplomatic capacity in order to save a deal that is very important for our security and, on the other hand, defending human rights in Iran and elsewhere with our sanctions regime, our diplomatic pressure and our permanent claim to respect human rights.  This has been a very intensive part-session. It was my first part-session, ‘mon baptême de feu’. I would like to thank all of you for all your contributions and for your support. I know that not everybody sees things in the same way. From the left to the right, there are different approaches and different understandings of what’s happening in this difficult world in which we have to live. Today, having covered four difficult issues, thank you all for your contribution and thank you for your support for my job.  (Applause)",

The new treaty between the EU and the ACP countries will consolidate and give new impetus to our strong partnership and we are happy to learn that we are approaching the final stage of concluding a treaty. However, there are still some problem issues, and they seem to concentrate on the issue of migration and mobility, and this is why I focus on this issue. The treaty is based on the principle of equality and shared responsibility. But if you look at the EU text proposal, it applies very concrete requirements on the ACP countries, such as readmission of migrants, strengthening border controls and combating irregular migration, whereas in exchange, the EU hardly offers any concrete commitment regarding legal migration. Adopting this text would deprive the countries of remittances and other benefits of migration, without any clear perspective on labour migration. This does not really resonate the equality of the partnership. Regarding shared responsibility, I find the only provision on refugees and international protection pretty meagre. Africa hosts so many more refugees than we do. Why don’t we see a stronger EU commitment to support the protection and reception of refugees through financial means or through resettlements? That would be shared responsibility, and also in line with the UN Global Compact on Refugees. The EU’s responsibility for refugees in Africa will even grow if this migration cooperation leads to more refugees stuck in transit countries without any access to asylum. So, if this paragraph is still in negotiation, please make sure that the EU also delivers on migration, mobility and international protection.",

Let me conclude by commending the European Parliament for its strong commitment and engagement on climate action, as well as for its commitment to human rights and the rights of indigenous peoples.  The US is one of our most important partners, with whom we exchange regularly on global challenges such as climate change, democracy and human rights. We will continue to exchange in the high—level climate action group that I have mentioned before, co-chaired by VP Timmermans and Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry. Both teams are in regular contact.  The European Union has a solid policy framework in place on human rights and this is a central element of our external action. We will continue the efforts to support and promote the realisation of our multilateral commitments and goals, including fighting climate change, ensuring a just energy transition and upholding human rights, including indigenous rights, across the globe.  So thank you again for your clear commitment. We will continue our exchange with our US partners. ",

Nearly ten months ago, the Commission adopted the Sustainable Europe Investment Plan, which is an investment plan for the European Green Deal. On that day I presented the plan to this Parliament. As I speak to you today, I’m struck by how much the world has changed since then. The EU fight against climate change and environmental degradation now takes place amid an unprecedented health and economic crisis of COVID—19. The EU has taken immediate action to fight the pandemic, and we are sparing no effort to support the economy. But as your report also highlights, the climate change crisis has not disappeared. Today, I assure you that the Sustainable Europe Investment Plan is as relevant as it was in January. In fact, it’s even more critical now as we support the economic recovery. Our commitment to become the first climate—neutral continent by 2050 remains firm, and we have proposed more ambitious emissions cuts by 2030. We will need massive investment to reach those goals. Through the Sustainable Europe Investment Plan, the EU set out how to generate at least one trillion euros of sustainable investments over the next decade. The Commission welcomes the historic agreement between the European Parliament and the Council on the EU’s next long—term budget and Next Generation EU. It will also be fundamental for the green recovery, but public finance will not be enough. Investor appetite for sustainable opportunities is on the rise. We will harness this demand by enabling frameworks, for example the EU taxonomy and EU Green Bond Standard. I’m happy that European financial institutions are also stepping up to the mark. Both the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development are increasing their ambitions in green finance and both are looking into using the EU taxonomy in their activities. International cooperation beyond EU borders is also needed to scale up sustainable finance. The EU’s key role in the International Platform for Sustainable Finance is at the heart of this global response. Honourable Members, our massive recovery package is fully in line with the Green Deal. The Commission also agrees with the Parliament that leaving no one behind is now more important than ever. We look forward to working with the European Parliament in translating these ambitions into relevant sectoral legislations. Your efforts will be an important reference point as we push ahead with our plan to finance the Green Deal in a sustainable and fair manner.",

We respond to the growing impacts of climate change and to gaps and vulnerabilities that opened up in the pandemic. And this directive really well complements our new DORA Act on financial services and our newly updated NIS 2 Directive for the resilience of digital infrastructure. And my colleagues already mentioned several other important legislation that has been built up in this House, and this is one of them. This is where the magic happens, too. It lowers the bureaucratic burden by creating a single point of contact for businesses on these three and more legislations and streamlines requirements and reporting. This is a huge success and showcases the true potential what benefits the EU and cooperation in general can bring. I am also happy to see that the risk assessment by Member States will now include cyber threats and risks for cross—sectoral or cross—border nature. This has been an important addition as we see our adversaries increasingly blurring the lines in their attacks and switching between domains. I was hoping that this period of security cooperation and open access will prevail. In the form which I proposed, we will find ways to regularly publish findings of the Critical Entities Resilience Group for the general public for use in academia and security research, of course, adequately anonymised. Unfortunately, we still have some trust to build in this, I see. That, of course, does not does not hinder the important work that has been done. This directive is timely and relevant, and it is my hope that Member States will diligently transpose it into their national laws, together with DORA and NIS 2.",

Instead of calls for ceasefires, dialogue and peace talks, we are deepening Western involvement in the war with no apparent concern for the repercussions. We are calling for Ukraine to take back Crimea. Experts on both sides of the ocean say that this was madness and will lead to a possible breakout of nuclear war. And it will also rally the Russian people towards the defence of Crimea, if we go to that space. Zelenskyy has been making the rounds begging for more weapons, but not one word to say about peace. How many of his own people must he conscript and feed into the carnage before he sits down to negotiations? And how many of the people of Europe must lose their jobs or their homes before NATO will allow these negotiations to happen? And lastly, I’d like to know what has happened to Germany, the jewel of Europe. Scholz told us that there’d be no peace in Europe without Russia.

        "speech": " au nom du vice-président de la Commission/haut représentant de l'Union pour les affaires étrangères et la politique de sécurité. – Madame la Présidente, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, permettez-moi tout d’abord de vous remercier pour cette opportunité d’échanger avec vous ce soir sur la lutte contre l’impunité en matière de crimes à l’encontre de journalistes à travers le monde. Je voudrais intervenir en lieu et place du haut représentant Josep Borrell, bien entendu, en plein accord avec lui sur ce que je vais vous dire. As the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists reminded, in some countries the already difficult situation for journalists is being exacerbated by the use of the pandemic as a pretext for additional restrictions on media freedom. Journalists play a fundamental role in the functioning of democracies. They help ensure accountability of those in power through the provision of timely and factual information. The Commission has said many times that democracy is fuelled by information. In other words, without information, democracy cannot work. Unfortunately, across the world journalists face intimidation, violence or abuse, often putting their lives at risk. Disturbingly, impunity for abuses and crimes against journalists and media workers remains widespread, reaching 90% of cases in some countries, according to a UNESCO report in 2019. We follow with concern reports of journalists being placed in detention without trial, the closure of media stations, and internet shutdowns in many countries. In this troubling context, the EU has stepped up its action. In all relations with other countries we have always been clear on the key role of unrestricted media and civil society and the need to protect human rights defenders, many of whom are journalists. Our EU delegations around the world have strengthened their response to attacks against journalists. A handbook on journalists’ safety has been distributed to all delegations. The delegations are producing or coordinating public statements and social media interventions to give visibility to EU support, observing court cases, identifying cases requiring special protection. In the last 12 months the EU has supported over 425 journalists with emergency grants, temporary relocation or support to their respective media outlets. Dedicated programmes have been operating in many regions for some time, with a total amount of support beyond EUR 180 million. One example is the programme Save Journalists, run by Western Balkan journalist associations. Recent programmes include COVID-19 response in Africa to gather available information, which brings together organisations such as Deutsche Welle Akademie and Reporters sans frontières to build resilience of journalists in Africa. Similar programmes are being finalised for Asia and Latin America. The safety of journalists is at the centre of EU advocacy for media freedom in intellectual fora and bilateral dialogues. We keep recalling the obligation to protect and promote freedom of opinion and expression and offering collaboration. We also work with the Council of Europe, OSCE and UNESCO, and we want to intensify this cooperation. In a similar plenary decision last year some priority areas were mentioned, on which we are making progress. As regards media freedom monitoring, the EU supports the projects of the Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom and of the European Centre for Press and Media Freedom, including its rapid response mechanism. As regards opposition to strategic lawsuits against public participation (the so-called SLAPPs), EU services are formulating a common approach. The next steps are to establish, first, a network of lawyers and media specialists to exchange practices and know-how regarding SLAPP cases, and second, a focus group on legal and financial aid to identify legal and practical solutions. On a more systematic fight against impunity, apart from the already-mentioned support, protection of media independence and journalist in the Member States was a key factor in the analysis that we did in the first annual rule of law report, which is at the centre of a new rule of law mechanism. Support to the reform of justice systems and the rule of law remains key in our external cooperation in over 70 countries, with more than 2.76 billion spent between 2007 and 2017 – in 10 years. In the future we will keep on working on ending impunity for crimes against journalists with two important tools: the EU action plan on human rights and democracy for the period 2020-2024, and the forthcoming European democracy action plan. As you can see, this topic is paramount to our work on the protection and promotion of human rights, and as the examples I mentioned clearly show, we totally agree, and join forces, with your Parliament on such an issue. And I want to add that, of course, it is very important – I have said about the rule of law annual report – to do the job at home to be able to organise our action outside of the European Union. Thank you for your attention, and I’m looking forward, of course, to your debate and maybe also to your remarks and proposals.",

This is the biggest package of economic recovery ever created by the European Union. We need to make sure that money reaches the intended beneficiaries. We need to make sure that money reaches people in need and reaches enterprises in need, reaches regions in need, and that all the rules are respected.  Commissioner, you may very well remember that during our negotiations for the Recovery and Resilience Facility, one of the primary concerns of this Parliament was respect for the rule of law. We said money can only flow because this is taxpayers’ money, because the Commission went to the markets to borrow the money. We are all putting ourselves, our taxpayers, in debt for it. Money can only flow if rules, if the rule of law, if European values, are respected, and Parliament was united on this with a very large majority.  This is why we need to know more about the plans that have not yet been adopted. You have mentioned Hungary, Poland and Sweden. We see that the Polish Government is threatening the Commission to start blocking files which should be agreed in a consent procedure. This while they further attack the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. This in itself is an attack upon our democratic institutions, our way of work, and to us it means that it has to be clarified.  Democratic scrutiny is a condition, and the European Parliament, the representatives of the people, have to be informed in detail about where we stand because the people in all Member States – including in the countries where we know there are problems, but you have to provide us with more details – the people in all countries expect money from the Recovery and Resilience Facility to fund the improvement of education, the improvement of public administration, the modernisation of the healthcare system, tackling pollution, reducing electricity bills, improving air quality infrastructure and so on.  So we need to make sure that the money is well spent, that no corrupt entity has access to these funds.

Let me be very clear. We have formulated new headline targets for 2030, but our action to reach them must start now, and indeed it has already started.  It must be joint action by all from those who bear concrete responsibilities at all levels: the European Parliament, obviously, the national parliaments, national governments, regional and local authorities, social partners and civil society actors.  First of all, we want to achieve an employment rate of 78% – as I’ve already said – in 2030. So there is a need to support the creation of more and better jobs. Here I have to be very clear. We have done a lot to preserve jobs, to keep people in jobs, but we have done a lot also to preserve companies, especially a lot of SMEs. And we have to do a lot to create new companies, new industries in Europe, and that’s also a very strong dimension of this Commission’s policies.  Work for jobs is why we put forward the Commission recommendation on effective active support for employment. It sets out guidance on investing in people and easing job—to—job transitions for those who are at risk of redundancy or are already unemployed. We also need to pursue our efforts to support young people. They are particularly vulnerable to this crisis. They are suffering a lot. They have lost their precarious jobs – if they had one. Therefore, better jobs, more secure jobs, highly productive and skilled jobs. This is what we are aiming at for our young, because it cannot be that with a recovery, the only prospects that we are offering them is again precarious jobs that they may lose from one day to another. The idea, this wrong alternative, that of better any job than no job, is a false alternative. What we have to do is really work on good jobs, investing in people. Beyond the recovery effort, it is essential to support the participation of women in the labour market. We need to at least halve the employment gap, promote access to early childhood education and care, and further promote the work—life balance.  Better jobs mean striving for better working conditions. We have already proposed ambitious legislation on adequate minimum wages. Two weeks ago, the Commission launched a consultation of EU social partners on decent working conditions and social protection for people working through platforms.  A major priority must concern skills and equality. If we are talking about effective labour market policies, we cannot emphasise enough the importance of skills for jobs. At least 60% of adults should participate in training every year by 2030. Skills empower people to adapt to change and skills are an ever more important source of our global competitiveness. The different actions and our European skills agenda are crucial to this end, and we will only successfully manage the green transition and the digital change transformation if we invest a lot in skills – and not just in the skills of those who are already skilled, but also in those who have lower skills, giving them better opportunities on the labour market. We must advance gender equality and equal opportunities for all, with a particular focus on youth. Last week’s proposal for a directive on binding pay transparency and enforcement measures and a new disability rights strategy are crucial.  (The speaker was interrupted by the European Anthem). (Laughter and applause)  That’s great. That’s really great. Thank you very much. Lastly, I want to emphasise the fight against rising inequality and poverty. This stands at the heart of the action plan. We want the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion to be reduced by at least, I insist, at least, 15 million. The fight against poverty requires stronger safety nets for those in need and robust social protection systems.  Later this month, we will table the long—anticipated proposal for a European child guarantee, which was born here in this Parliament. We will also launch a European platform on combating homelessness, and next year we will come forward with a Council recommendation on minimum income. I agree social investments are key and, particularly in this recovery, we have to build a more resilient society and therefore we have to mobilise European funds and support social enterprises by proposing a social economy action plan.  Dear President, honourable Members, we can only achieve our ambitions for a green and digital transition by covering also the social dimension. Social progress has to be embedded in our recovery strategy and to become a driving principle of our post—COVID European agenda.  That is what’s at stake in Porto – an economy that works for all people. That’s what we are aiming at. ",

With a share of 7% of global CO2 emissions, the EU relies on large nations from other parts of the world to join in on the climate measures. But they are not.  China and India currently depend on cheap energy like coal, oil and gas. As we use less of it, it gets cheaper and they will use more. This means that we are subsidising their consumption and hurting our own economy, all while we’re not decreasing total global emissions.  The solution isn’t more unrealistic goal-setting and climate socialism, but investing in research, technology and innovation, instead of bankrupting both our citizens and our companies.",

For 10 years the UN has been unable to protect against forcible disappearances, chemical attacks and targeting of civilian infrastructure, and now it cannot even deliver aid.

In this fight against cancer, as politicians and as institutions of the EU, we should use all the EU tools available. Let me reiterate that the Finnish Presidency stands ready to cooperate with the European Parliament to raise awareness of the challenges that cancer represents for Europe and for Europeans. Our own initiative, the concept of the economy of well-being, is something which also delivers in the fight against cancer. It is important to support research. From that point of view, the provisional agreement on including a cancer mission in the future Horizon Europe is essential and the Presidency firmly supports that.

Secondly, it makes the Internet a better place without interfering with freedom of expression. The DSA holds platforms accountable for what they do and not for what their users think or write in their posts.  And finally, it tackles the information asymmetry. Today, platforms know everything about us because they collect our data. But the little we know, we learned from whistle-blowers, like Frances Haugen. And this is why the risk assessment and the access to the data of the platforms for independent researchers, also from civil society organisations, is so important because they will provide us with the evidence we need to regulate well. And they will be able to tell the stories about how social networks influence our public opinion, our politics, or the health of our children.

This is why we have to support the EPBD.  It paves the way for the reduction of our energy consumption and our bills. It focuses on lifting our households from energy poverty. It also insists on the Member States to ring-fence dedicated funds for renovation, and at the same time it gives flexibility to the Member States to adapt the targets depending on their economic and social situation. It also offers flexibility for derogation when it comes to the labour workers, to the construction sector, but at the same time it keeps the ambitious goals of reaching the climate targets we have set and protecting from energy poverty our citizens.

The adoption of these policies today, and the aim of carbon neutrality by 2050, is nothing short of reckless and the most extreme example of economic illiteracy I’ve ever seen. The fact that amendments were rejected demanding a full impact assessment shows rank indifference to the cost and practicality of aggressive climate policies.  One thing I can say for certain is that the impact of net zero makes the consequence of any form of Brexit look puny by comparison. Dieter Helm, Professor of Energy and Economics at Oxford University, was right when he said: ‘We should be honest that it is a huge industrial undertaking, and it will have significant cost.

With the imposition by Beijing of the draconian national security law in 2020, China broke its promise 27 years before the deadline it had agreed.  We have witnessed the rapid dismantling of one country, two systems. This is a breach of China’s international commitments, notably the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration registered at the UN as an international treaty. We have seen the rapid shrinking of space for civil society, the step-by-step shut—down of independent media, the silencing of voices of dissent. The law has been used to stifle political pluralism and the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms that are protected under Hong Kong law and international law.  The arrests of 90-year-old Cardinal Zen, pro-democracy former lawmaker Margaret Ng, pop star Denise Ho Wan-see and scholar Hui Po-Keung for alleged conspiracy to collude with foreign powers marked another step in this grim trajectory. Another trustee of the 612 Humanitarian Relief Fund, former Legislative Council member Cyd Ho, was arrested on the same charges while already serving a prison sentence.  Hong Kong has moved from being a spatial administration region of China characterised by democracy, pluralism and a vibrant civil society, to hosting one of the fastest growing populations of political prisoners in the world: 1 014 political prisoners have been held in Hong Kong since June 2019. More than three quarters of them are under 30 years old.  The EU has spoken out repeatedly about the deterioration of the situation in Hong Kong. Last week, on 1 July, the EU again reiterated publicly its concerns at the removal of fundamental freedoms previously enjoyed by the people of Hong Kong. On the ground, the EU is committed to supporting the civil society that still remains, notably by attending hearings and trials such as the first hearing of the subjects of today’s debate.  China claims that what is happening in Hong Kong is an internal matter. We reject this. The EU has a strong stake and interest in Hong Kong and will not cease its support for universal values within and beyond its borders. We will continue to stand by the people of Hong Kong.",

And him and his staff deserve credit for that. But having said that, the final text is just not credible for us in terms of the sector dealing adequately with its decarbonisation requirements, primarily because of the decision to broaden the definition of sustainable aviation fuels, which we strenuously oppose on the grounds that this is actually not sustainable. Without the caps and restrictions, the text opened the door for new biofuels, which are just not suitable for air transport. And during the discussions, we did warn about the risks of fraud with, for example, used cooking oil, which is mainly imported from outside the EU. While we have strengthened the text to improve the information provided by suppliers, at the same time, there’s no sign of a cap as applied in the Renewable Energy Directive, which we thought was very unfortunate. So, obviously aviation is energy intensive. The demands for the feedstocks qualified by the current definition would be absolutely enormous. It includes by—products of the palm oil industry, intermediate crops, and would produce massive risks for land-use change, disastrous for the environment, communities and biodiversity. And what we’re really trying to do here is square a circle. We’re accepting increased demand, which in turn means increased fuel—led demand for feedstocks which are considered sustainable while at the same time their availability is limited. This is in contradiction with the energy strategy promoted by European authorities, which involves also trying to address lowering consumption. And we’re not doing that in this report. Aviation is going to continue to be dependent on fossil fuels for a long time, the price of which is going to continue to rise and be borne by workers, passengers and the climate. I think it’s all well and good to debate different targets up to 2050, but even if we have a target of 100%, it’s not going to matter if the definition allows inappropriate feedstocks. So, if we don’t address that, we simply cannot vote for this report. I also think the exclusion of private aircraft – so the wealthy who create most of the problems anyway again are being excluded and pay the least – is regrettable, and the exclusion of military aircraft is also regrettable, particularly in the period of increased traffic.

But, you know, you can’t go to work or school if you’re starving or if you’re dead, and against the backdrop of the cataclysmic collapse of the Afghan economy, in a bitterly cold winter where the World Food Programme is predicting that one million children will die of starvation in two months.  Against that backdrop, the US, the world’s most powerful economy, appropriates in broad daylight the resources of this, the world’s poorest country, and we say nothing. EUR 7 billion in US banks belonging to the people of Afghanistan. No emergency meetings. No statements from the High Representative. No demands for international law to be upheld. No comment, even, on this colonial act of banditry. Biden’s step will mean millions of Afghans suffering and dying for a crime that had nothing to do with them. It makes me sick.

Naturally, the subject raises a lot of interest and I am happy to see that we agree on the need for an ambitious and accelerated deployment of renewables across all the relevant sectors.  Right now, we face many challenges, whether it’s the transition to climate neutrality or securing home-grown cheap electricity production. The deployment of renewables is crucial in addressing these. But I hear a lot from industries how important regulatory stability is for investment certainty, and this is what we are providing the industry with today.  There are some challenges posed by the accelerated and ambitious deployment of renewables – some of you mentioned these today. The Commission stands ready to work with industry and with the Member States to address them over the course of the implementation of the directive. With this in mind, I look forward to the vote and to having the new Renewable Energy Directive approved.",

        "speech": " membre de la Commission. – Monsieur le Président, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, d’abord je voudrais remercier le Parlement d’avoir organisé ce débat parce qu’il touche à l’un des problèmes majeurs qui est au cœur de nos préoccupations en matière d’exclusion sociale et de misère. Le nombre de sans-abri ne cesse de croître en Europe. D’ailleurs, il suffit de se promener dans nos villes pour s’en rendre compte. Habiter un logement décent à un prix raisonnable et dans un environnement sûr est un besoin fondamental que l’on peut considérer comme un droit de l’homme. La situation des sans-abri est un défi de taille dans un nombre croissant de pays européens. Il n’existe pas de chiffres officiels et comparables sur l’étendue de ce défi. Toutefois, les quelques chiffres dont nous avons connaissance indiquent que le nombre de sans-abri a augmenté dans la majorité des États membres au cours de la dernière décennie. On estime à quelque trois millions le nombre de sans-abri en Europe. Chaque nuit, plus de 400 000 personnes dorment dans nos rues. C’est un problème quotidien et tangible auquel nous sommes confrontés dans nos villes et qui nous interpelle. Les causes de ce problème sont multiples et complexes, mais il est établi que les paramètres des marchés du logement ainsi que les politiques du logement ont un impact direct et considérable sur le sans-abrisme, qui est une forme d’extrême exclusion et qui touche particulièrement les groupes vulnérables, notamment les personnes handicapées et les migrants. Les analyses récentes identifient plus précisément la hausse des prix du logement et la pénurie de logements sociaux comme facteur clé. En effet, la hausse des prix à la location et à l’achat rend le logement de moins en moins accessible. À ce titre, les logements sociaux, la surveillance des marchés ainsi que les allocations logement peuvent potentiellement venir en aide aux ménages. Il demeure que de nombreux citoyens, sans devenir des sans-abris, peuvent pâtir et souvent pâtissent des fluctuations des marchés et des politiques du logement et notamment des prix qui, littéralement, explosent. La crise du logement est liée à un manque d’investissements. Le groupe de travail de haut niveau sur les investissements dans l’infrastructure sociale en Europe estimait dans son rapport de 2018 que les déficits d’investissement, dans les logements abordables, se chiffrent à près de 57 milliards d’euros dans l’Union européenne. Although the Union does not have the competence on housing – which is often a local competence in the Member States – social housing and homelessness play an important role within the EU’s social policy agenda. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU stipulates that the Union recognises and respects the right to social and housing assistance so as to ensure a decent existence for all those who lack sufficient resources, in accordance with Community law and national laws and practices. The European Pillar of Social Rights includes a principle dedicated to housing and assistance for the homeless. It is a clear political signal on the importance that the European Union attaches to the fight against homelessness and housing exclusion. The European Pillar of Social Rights sets the bar high by promoting the reintegration of homeless people into society by means of enabling social services. The Commission will now launch a broad consultation on the implementation of the pillar at a national, regional and local level. The EU’s role will be to work alongside all levels of governance for the benefit of citizens, and housing should also be a focus of this process. Principle 19 of the pillar is included among the areas of investment of the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) for the post—2020 Multiannual Financial Framework. Applying the integrated housing—led approach, housing action supported by the ERDF should be combined with thematic areas that can be supported through ESF+. In addition, we foresee an increased guarantee for social infrastructure within the proposed InvestEU, the EU’s future financial instrument for investments. The European Fund for Strategic Investments is already playing a key role by financing a wide range of social infrastructure investment projects, including affordable social housing projects. Through the European Semester, the Commission provides Member States with policy support, guidance and orientation on how to design efficient national policies aimed at ensuring citizens’ access to affordable and accessible social housing by stressing housing supply shortage, dysfunctional housing markets, macroeconomic imbalances and insufficient stock of social housing. The issue of homelessness has to be fully taken into account at the level of our policies fighting poverty. The Commission has shown its readiness to support Member States when and where possible on tackling homelessness. A good example is the integrated housing-led approach, which follows the principles of Housing First, that is: combining the provision of immediate housing with enabling services to empower homeless people to sustain their tenancy, promote stable living conditions and prevent repeat homelessness. Through the tools at its disposal, the Commission enables the exchange of good practices and learning between Member States. The Commission also directly supports FEANTSA, a European—level network of national organisations focusing exclusively on the fight against homelessness and housing exclusion. It runs concrete projects at the local level and has benefited from close to EUR 5 million-worth of grants from the European Commission.",

And you may call that country a safe third country’. This is why Italy said yes. And why von der Leyen promised EUR 1 billion to Tunisia, a country where people are fleeing violence and persecution? Selling responsibility is the new norm inside and outside the EU. And after the sale, why care for people’s right to protection, dignity and life? Because, hey, we sold that, didn’t we?

But of course we are not on our own in that regard. I would like to highlight and recall the terrible plight of Michael Power from Waterford, the former Chief Financial Officer of Tcell, the mobile phone operator in Tajikistan, 60% owned by Telia, largely owned by the Swedish State. This company was previously involved in tax corruption in Uzbekistan and when Power exposed to them serious tax fraud and bribery in their organisation, as he was legally obliged to do, he was victimised, threatened and dismissed. Protected disclosure legislation is supposed to out wrongdoing in the public interest. But for Michael Power, the legal process is being used to subvert his protected disclosure. He is locked in procedural legal matters. If we want to deal with tax evasion, we have to protect people and protected disclosures.",

        "speech": "representative of Renew Group. – Madam President, in the last few years we have seen a sea change in the way politics and elections are conducted. We may still deliver leaflets, knock on doors and transmit party political broadcasts on TV, but increasingly our voters are getting their information online through social media platforms and cleverly targeted advertising that takes advantage of ever more effective algorithms to target them individually from thousands of miles away.  It’s fair to say that citizens all over Europe are at the mercy of anyone with a sinister agenda and a computer. We are undergoing a quantum leap in our electoral processes, one that eclipses the advent of the printing press, the newspaper, the radio and the television, but the gap between this evolving technology, on the one hand, and regulation and legislation on the other, has now become a great digital chasm. Both literally and metaphorically, the old rules cease to apply as our legislation falls woefully behind reality. The stubborn refusal of companies such as Facebook to take clear and decisive action to police their platforms opens a door into our elections that any foreign actor can waltz through unimpeded. The proper regulation of platforms such as Facebook is not an infringement on freedom of speech. It is our moral duty. We must take stronger action against fake profiles and accounts. We must strengthen the EU Code of Conduct on disinformation, and we must reform electoral laws to cater for the modern era. We must investigate the financing of political parties by the Kremlin. For instance, in the UK, we know that Russian oligarchs have paid huge sums of money to play tennis with Boris Johnson.  Hostile governments are taking advantage of the digital space to interfere in our elections to further their own political goals. With over 50 national, regional and local elections due in Europe before the end of 2020, we must start taking this threat seriously. Those who detest the idea of democracy and view the messy process of elections as a charade to shore up their positions – Vladimir Putin chief amongst them – pour millions in economic and human resources into targeting European voters.  We have seen this in the UK, France and Spain, too. But it’s not just Putin who is playing this sinister game. We know that Dominic Cummings, who is advising our own government, spent time in Russia. This must be investigated, and there are many in this House who are here because of the darling of the US alt-right, Steve Bannon. There are those within our own Member States who are more than happy to accept the help of these external actors in their quest for power. I would look at Nigel Farage but he hasn’t turned up this week. I also look to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom who has refused to disclose a parliamentary report on Russian interference in the Brexit referendum of 2016. He knows what is in that report. We know what is in that report, but he refuses to release it because the truth stands in the way of his personal ambition. Boris Johnson – release the Russia report now!  Things have got so bad that in the UK electoral campaign the government is now impersonating fact-checking websites to spread misinformation. Vladimir would be proud. He doesn’t even need to interfere any more. That one of the oldest political parties in Europe is willing to do this, says much about how foreign electoral interference takes root, infects our society and becomes the norm.  There must be a parliamentary response to this unacceptable behaviour and there must be decisive action, both in Member States and in Europe, and yet politicians have so far come up short. Facebook still operates as the Trojan horse into our democracy. The time has come for this new Parliament, for this new Commission, for this new reality we live in, to get serious. If not, we will be forever at the mercy of any authoritarian at a keyboard. I welcome your opinion, colleagues, and I hope you sense the same danger that I do. (Applause)",

The amendment to ensure transparency in relation to the giant procurement of vaccines and therapeutics is certainly positive. Yet there is no reference to civil society oversight in relation to advance purchase agreements. Therefore, negotiations will continue to be carried on behind closed doors.  There is nothing in relation to future advance purchase agreements that would guarantee global access and affordability, as well as the transfer of manufacturing know—how. Vaccines should be a public good for everyone that wants it, including the global south. Doing secret deals with Big Pharma behind closed doors is really soul—destroying for the people of Europe. ",

        "speech": " President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, honourable Members, if you allow me, I might remark that speaking about health at such a late hour is a bit contradictory. Having been at this very plenary since 9.00 this morning, I think we all should be resting already at this point – if we think about our health. Nevertheless, however, it is a pleasure to discuss with you the recent high-level event that took place on 23 September in the context of the United Nations General Assembly on Universal Health Coverage: Moving Together to Build a Healthier World. That event brought together heads of states, political and health leaders, policy makers and universal health coverage champions, to advocate for better health for all. Universal health coverage means that all people, including the most vulnerable – or should I say, especially the most vulnerable – have access to the health care they need, when and where they need it, without facing financial hardship. The aim was to harness financial and political commitments to sustain health investments, with the focus on accelerating progress towards universal health coverage, including access to essential health services, a skilled health workforce, financial risk protection and access to safe, quality, effective and affordable medicines and vaccines for all. This ambitious aim was achieved in the form of an action-oriented political declaration on universal health coverage endorsed by heads of states representing the entire United Nations membership. This is all the more remarkable as this was our last opportunity before 2023 – the midway point, to reach the sustainable development goals by 2030 – to mobilise the highest levels of political support, to bring the entire health agenda under the umbrella of universal health coverage. The declaration is accompanied by a concrete global action plan for healthy lives and well-being that will serve as a blueprint for global health and development agencies as well as national governments to meet health needs. We are all aware, of course, that big question marks still remain concerning the significant financing needed now until 2030 in order to live up to our ambitious commitments. This will have to be secured through a mix of domestic financing based on individual country contexts, and international aid-funding mechanisms. This is no doubt our main task ahead. It is daunting, but our credibility will be at stake if we fail. Finally, I would like to stress the leadership role that the EU and its Member States must continue to play on the issue of universal health coverage, in the multilateral context that is so dear to us but which we should not take for granted. 2020 will be a test year in that regard, with the 25th anniversary reviews of the 1994 Cairo International Conference on Population and Development and the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action. The EU and its Member States will need to position themselves at the forefront to protect the progress achieved 25 years ago and ensure that there is no stepping back. Such European leadership was demonstrated once again during the high-level event on universal health coverage, and I wish to commend Minister Kaag of the Netherlands for leading a strong coalition of 58 countries in support of sexual and reproductive health and rights. These are part and parcel of the 2030 agenda and a cornerstone of a universal health coverage. Investing in sexual and reproductive health and rights is affordable and cost-saving and can make health coverage truly universal, in line with our key promise under the 2030 agenda: that we shall leave no one behind. I want to stress that the Presidency will spare no effort to continue to promote universal access to health care, which all human beings, in particular the most vulnerable, need, when and where they need it, in line with the ‘economy of well-being’ approach introduced by our Finnish Presidency.",

Now we managed to protect families from a new carbon price and we will invest EUR 44.5 billion EU funding into supporting them in social climate measures.

Now let’s make absolutely sure that we focus on lifting those vulnerable households out of energy and mobility poverty – not only SMEs as the EPP is proposing. We already have enough funds to support those SMEs and at the same time there’s nothing to support the poorest families. How is that even possible when people right now can’t even afford to heat their own homes?  Finally, we need to make those biggest polluters pay, and that means getting rid of the free allowances as soon as possible.

We have all witnessed recently how national vetoes have dramatically been to the advantage of the few bad guys in the room. National vetoes have been used in bad faith against European interests.  They have been an instrument to pressure you against your own will when you were deciding on essential European policies together. They have made your efforts to find common ground more fragile and all of this has threatened our security. It has also allowed the misuse of the money of European citizens. And some important files became simple pawns in a cynical gambling game.  And why? Smaller Member States should not fear the end of unanimity, Europe has grown and changed. You can protect your interests through qualified majority, and you have proven that you are good at finding these majorities when needed.  Throughout this term, I have had the most respect for the Czech Presidency, the Finnish Presidency, the Portuguese Presidency. You were the ones that brought everyone around the table to talk about difficult topics and try to make progress. And you were the ones that engaged sincerely with Parliament.

However, we know that citizens feel disconnected from the EU decision-making process. In the context of the Conference on the Future of Europe, I did a tour of my country to discuss with citizens about their expectations from the EU. One of the takeaways from this tour is the fact that citizens want to be listened to; they want to be a part of the decision-making process. It is not enough to call them to vote every five years. We need to find ways to take this energy from the citizens and insert it into the political process every year.  I believe that involving citizens in the mechanism that produces the Commission Work Programme could be a way to achieve this. This is why I have proposed the implementation of an Annual European Agora that will take input from citizens regarding the main priorities of the EU and include it in the decision-making process that builds the work programme. Hopefully, through the Conference, we will also have input from the citizens present in the programme of 2023.",

The mechanism has adjudicated hundreds of cases between member countries (and Bernd mentioned it), including more than 120 brought by the United States against trade-distorting measures of other nations. It has helped to strengthen the rules-based international legal order with, by the way, the United States as one of its major beneficiaries. Today, this legal order is under threat. The veto of the US administration – and it did not start with Trump, it started already with Obama – appointing any new judges to the Appellate Body will effectively block its capability to resolve disputes. Of course, we recognise the legitimate concerns of our American partners: it is true that the Appellate Body must not overstep its mandate. But disabling it through obstruction is short sighted. For that reason I call on the Commission to intensify its engagement in order to unblock the appointments procedure as a matter of priority, like we should do in this House. History is full of examples of trade disputes escalating into armed conflict. Trade wars led to real wars. Let us today unite in support of the rules-based trading order in support of the WTO. I’m very happy that even the Greens now fight for the WTO, which you did not for so many years; you should have done earlier and in support of this motion.",

So, of course, the Commission will come back to Parliament when we have that assessment in due course.  On the second question, when you look at the Horizon Europe provisions, we have an article, I think it’s 22.5, which allows us to close certain calls for entities where we think that there might be a risk. And so far, when you look at emerging technologies, that could be, for instance, quantum, I think no Chinese or Chinese control directly or indirectly have been part of those calls. The Chinese are, I think, world-leading when it comes to quantum. Europe is also very far ahead. But because of that, we found that it’s important that funding in specific strategic sectors goes to entities where we know for sure that we can vouch for how they are working with it. So I think that is a good example of how we have a general provision that can be used specifically on different areas where we find that things may be at risk. These are few areas, because the openness of research also increases the level and the resilience of the research community. But there are areas where it is important to say ‘thank you but no thank you’ to entities participating in the calls.",

Because everybody can see today what is happening with national vetoes, on every file. More and more of these files are blocked today. The last days, the last weeks: migration strategy, Schengen, electoral law, energy, price cap on gas, taxation policy, the minimum rate on multinationals, further sanctions and further financial aid to Ukraine, where we need to find now a solution with 26 instead of a solution inside the Union. So it’s clear that, in my opinion, vetoes are an instrument for blackmailing the Union, and it is increasing for the moment. I know that we asked for a convention to seriously discuss this. And again, due to the lack of consensus, the Council is not in a position to respond to that request. So I know that we have a discussion on Wednesday with the European Council, but it’s only 2 hours. What we are going to discuss is Ukraine, and we’re going to discuss energy. So I request that we need to urgently debate before the Council on Thursday, and my proposal will be to add that item Wednesday afternoon as the second point on the agenda.",

Very important, in my view, first to understand where this social emergency is coming from. I am not referring to, of course, our historical problems of social inequalities, but I am referring to the recent social emergency. And I think that the reason is not on the green transition. The reason is not on sanctions. The main reason is the Russian aggression in Ukraine and the consequences of this Russian aggression on prices, energy, food, inflation. How to face this challenge? I think several good points came out of this discussion. I will only stress three things. First, the emergency. So our social safety nets, the contribution that we can give at European level to those social safety nets. Important I think that we reached an agreement on the recommendation on the minimum income and ensuring active inclusion. Important the Minimum Wages Directive. Important to address the windfall profits both at EU and national level. Second is energy. We have some good news: tonight we reached the agreement of this new tool, RePowerEU, but we know that further steps are needed to address the problems for the reform of the electricity market. And third is what kind of reaction we are giving overall to this. I don’t think that the same old recipes are those that we are supposed to use now. We have new tools. This NextGenerationEU recovery plan is the basis for investing on the resilience of our societies. We are proud of our social model, but we want to strengthen this social model also with the common resources of NextGenerationEU. And then we need to invest more in the European competitiveness because we have to avoid that the social crisis which is already there in the purchasing power becomes gradually also an unemployment crisis, which is not there at the moment. But of course, if we lose competitiveness, if we don’t invest in our competitiveness, the risk is there. So I think that also this part of the response is very, very important.",

The world economy is changing, and the digital sector will be pivotal in Europe’s geopolitical standing and will be a key driver of economic growth, and also in helping us to achieve our climate change goals in a manner that ensures prosperity. How businesses, consumers and governments access, utilise, and share data is at the core of digitalisation and will ultimately determine how the EU adapts to a new global economic complexion. The DSA is a landmark proposal to regulate the digital space, to protect fundamental rights of users and provide clarity to businesses as to their rights and obligations. In this regard, it will allow European digital companies to reach new customers and compete internationally. It is a not a new problem, but the pandemic has exacerbated the spread of disinformation, especially in relation to vaccines. This is something that every democracy should pay particular attention to. Disinformation spreaders now have a well-oiled machine to spread their harmful lies, the consequences of which will continue to create an augmented reality for many citizens. The DSA will help to tackle harmful content, which might not necessarily be illegal, and the spread of disinformation. It will also increase transparency for consumers and strengthen the rights of users on big platforms. At the same time, it will lead to more effective removal of illegal content, increase transparency for consumers, and strengthen the rights of users who have been mistreated by big platforms.

This is why the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality has prepared a resolution on the impact of this war on girls and women, which strongly condemns the Russian aggression and orders the EU and its Member States to ensure that women seeking refuge in Europe receive all the support they need. Every day, independent media alert us that mass rapes, sexual and gender—based violence, torture and genocide are being used as a weapon of this war. We will not rest until the perpetrators of those crimes are brought to justice. This is the promise, this is the declaration which must be heard today in this House.  But, even when they are, deeply wounded lives might never recover from such a trauma. Since the beginning of the Russian aggression, more than 5 million people have been forced to flee the country, with an estimated 90% of refugees being girls, women and children. As European citizens, we have reacted to the incoming refugees with unprecedented solidarity and, for the first time, the Council of the EU triggered the Temporary Protection Directive. From this place, I want to thank you, Commissioner Johansson, for your personal involvement in this case.  However, this is merely the first step and Member States need to increase their efforts in this regard. The risk of violence and sexual exploitation does not end once vulnerable women and children cross the border, as human traffickers increasingly profit from the crisis. Member States must improve the registration of all refugees and volunteers and ensure refugees can travel safely.  People need specialised support as survivors of violence. Those women need to gain access to livelihoods, including their ability to work and earn income to get stability and possible independence. The economic empowerment of women and integration is crucial here. Women within Ukraine and in the host EU countries require access to the full range of sexual reproductive health services. It is therefore absolutely unacceptable that, for instance, women seeking refuge in Poland – the EU country with the highest proportion of refugees – are forced to continue pregnancies that are the result of a brutal rape.  Finally, we need to ease the burden on civil society as they have worked tirelessly to help refugees, filling the gaps created by the sometimes slow and indecisive actions of our governments. It is high time that the Member States step up their efforts here.  Considering all the above, I would like to ask the Commissioner and the Commission what specific strategies to prevent and combat the trafficking of women and children is the EU implementing in this context? Second, what is your role in providing support to coordinating health services on the refugees’ arrival in the EU, which ensures that women have access to the full range of sexual and reproductive health services, including emergency contraception, contraception itself, legal and safe abortion care, antenatal care and skilled assistance during childbirth. Third, what is the EU’s role in collecting evidence against war atrocities that have been committed, in particular investigating war crimes, including rape? Fourth, what are the EU’s medium—term plans for managing the situation of women refugees?  (The speaker spoke in a non-official language) Long live the heroic Ukrainian women. ",

Obviously, we all know when it comes to climate ambition and keeping the global warming to 1.5 degrees, or even close to that, we as Europe also need to do more. So when it comes to the land—use sector, my view is that this is the starting point. We are now starting for the first time to have a proper increase of carbon—sink policy, and this is the basis where we will build on post 2030 to continue increasing our carbon sinks. When it comes to Member States’ contributions, there were some who were saying that some Member States need to do more, some less, and this is unfair. Well, everybody needs to contribute more in comparison to the inventory years. I think it is important also for the Commission and as a parliament to send a signal that those countries to actually start to think about land use in a different way. How can we increase sustainability in a way that is good for economics as well, that creates jobs, that will be more productive for agriculture, for forestry, and takes more into consideration to biodiversity as well? They will also be better off in the future. So if they postpone having a proper carbon—sink policy, my view is that some Member States still don’t have one. They just report what has happened. The Commission needs to intervene. You have the tools in this regulation to intervene and help Member States to realise that tapping into regenerative farming and forestry is a possibility for the Member States, for the economics, but also a necessity for the climate. Finally, also the compromise includes the review for the Commission to go through in late 2024 what to do beyond this. There is very clear language also that all land—use sectors need to contribute. So we need to also see how agriculture will be better climate wise, how we can support carbon farming and also public policies, not just private companies’ contributions. When it comes to forestry, we need to look at better management methods, cascading principal, higher added value for products, so getting more economic wellbeing out of less amount of resources. So the harvesting amounts we do have today are a problem, and we need to also solve that, not just going for the bulk industry when it comes to forestry, but have more higher end products with lesser impact for negative impact for climate and biodiversity. That is to say, for the economics of this sector as well, as well as all the other sectors – they are not going to succeed, but are trying to hang on to bad practices.",

        "speech": " Member of the Commission. – Madam President, dear Secretary of State, honourable Members, I would like to congratulate the Spanish Presidency for reaching an agreement in the Council on the draft budget for 2024 and to thank you for presenting it today. I am here to defend the Commission’s proposal again. The draft budget is a balanced proposal to finance the 2024 budget within the MFF as it currently stands, in line with the Union’s political priorities to stimulate the recovery and facilitate the greener digital transition, while always ensuring EU added value, impact and results on the ground. The draft budget does not yet address some of the challenges and uncertainties stemming from the war in Ukraine, which we have included in the mid-term review for the multiannual financial framework, and I will come back to this in a moment. The Council-proposed cut of the commitments by EUR 772 million, in our reading, is again not accompanied by adequate justifications and it does not reflect the priorities expressed by the Council itself. Of course, I have to admit the Council’s cut is smaller than last year’s at this stage. In particular, the cuts on heading one – it’s about single market innovation and digital – are at odds with the priority given to this heading by many Member States. The proposed cuts to Horizon Europe and Digital Europe would mean that programmes which should be boosting European competitiveness may be hampered and delayed. Based on today’s Council position, the Commission would not be able to fully implement the European Chips Act and the Union’s secure connectivity programme, which we approved only recently.  As regards the cut to the financing costs of NextGenerationEU, the EURI interest line in heading 2b, we will include an updated amount in the amending letter in October, when we will have a better view of the volume of disbursements in the second half of the year. Contrary to most other budget lines, the amount to be put on that line is really a technical exercise, rather than a political decision. We will probably be able to lower the amount needed. As regards heading seven, I appreciate that the Council has recognised the efforts made by the Commission to contain the level of administrative expenditure and to apply the same rigour for all institutions. The mobilisation of the single margin instrument is necessary to offset the impact of high inflation and soaring energy prices on the administrative expenditure of the institutions. We are currently reassessing the exact needs for both 23 and 24, notably based on more up-to-date information on the salary adjustment for 23. It is, however, clear that the administration remains under substantial pressure, both because of high inflation but also because of new political demands for Union action, which require additional resources. So what are the next steps? We will revise – as appropriate and if needed – our proposal for the EURI interest line and heading seven in the amending letter. This will also include the usual update to agricultural expenditure and possibly some further elements of a more technical nature. Following Parliament’s reading, I will send you the usual executability letter just before the start of the conciliation. I will do my best to facilitate the process and reach a successful outcome on all budgetary files. We all understand the challenges for the Union budget, including the rising interest rates and inflation. This will need to be addressed in the revision of the multiannual financial framework. Before I conclude, let me touch upon the link between the annual budget and the MFF mid-term review. These are formally, of course, two separate files and have to be negotiated in parallel. It is inevitable that the two discussions impact one another. I hope that we can make quick progress in the mid-term review negotiations to allow the implementation of the 2024 budget to be based on the revised MFF. I cannot stress enough how important it is for all of us to have the budget for next year adopted before the end of this year, in particular, ahead of the European elections.",

It divides townlands, farms, even homes; it makes no economic, political or geographical sense. For centuries, Britain maintained its presence by force of arms. When it could no longer occupy the whole island, it imposed an unwanted border leading to continued tension and conflict. Unfortunately, this border remains a point of tension while it exists. The conversation on Irish unity as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement has now taken centre stage in Ireland, north and south, and many people in the north now see unity as their way back into the EU. The majority of the north voted against leaving the EU, with many viewing the Irish peace process as a European success story. The TCA protects our peace process by providing a special status for the north of Ireland but there is a democratic deficit. Under the TCA, elected representatives in the north of Ireland have no role or no voice in shaping legislation they will be bound by. The importance of this Parliament’s resolution is that it calls for dialogue between the EU and political representatives and civic society in the north of Ireland. Let me be clear, this dialogue is vital and will contribute to reducing tensions and allowing the people of the whole island of Ireland to define their European future together.",

I say the Energy Charter Treaty is the most problematic example of a structure that keeps us locked into fossil fuels, that makes us slow down the urgently—needed transition.  Dear Commissioner, even under the reformed ECT, three private arbitrators will still have full power to condemn states to pay billions for the offence of curbing climate change. Existing investments in fossil fuels will stay protected for at the very least 10 more years, a period that can easily add up to 20 years with ratification time, and investors will still be able to get compensation for hypothetical lost future profits.  We are continuing to give public insurance to stranded assets. If the modernisation ever enters into force for us, it will be as much of a trap as the current treaty, with the 20—year sunset clause remaining, which you also criticised just right now. In the current state of climate emergency these weaknesses of the modernised ECT are not acceptable.  Dear Commissioner, dear colleagues, I believe it is time to be bold and reconsider the EU’s membership of this treaty.

It is important to note that the primary purpose of the conditionality regulation and this resolution is not to bully any Member State. The existing conditionality regulation serves actually as the best preventive measure in place.  Two weeks ago, the Budgetary Control Committee of this House conducted a fact—finding mission in Hungary. The message of this crucial mission was clear: EU funds must be distributed to Hungarian citizens and the economy in a fair and unbiased manner and in accordance with the protection of the Union budget. During this mission, our delegation uncovered various shortcomings, including issues with public procurement concerns regarding the effectiveness of the State Audit Office, discriminatory measures against certain businesses, etc. For example, sudden changes – as the Commissioner mentioned –to laws and to the budgetary process are clear evidence of still breaching the rule of law, especially when it comes to legal certainty in Hungary.  So, dear Members, in these unprecedented times, it is imperative that the Council is led by a country capable of strong collaboration among Member States in decision making, particularly on critical matters such as sanctions against Russia or support for Ukraine. We will therefore keep a close eye on how the rule of law situation on the ground in Hungary develops in the coming months and going into next year. ",

        "speech": "on behalf of the Renew Group. – Madam President, just a quick few reactions to your proposals, Ms von der Leyen. I was very happy to hear about the RRF2, this Recovery Reconstruction Fund using the lessons from what we learned for Ukraine. That’s good news. There was no news on how to finance it, so I hope that’s coming. Also, I think that spending on reconstruction is very good, but as you very well said, there are very urgent funding needs and we need to see how we’re going to address them. And thirdly, you mentioned the embargo on oil. This Parliament is really happy to hear that, congratulations and that’s great news that we are moving on the oil embargo. But as you know, this is far short of what this Parliament wants. We actually asked, a month ago, for a full embargo on gas and oil. While the debate goes on, the EU has sent EUR 50 billion to Russia since the start of the year, EUR 52 billion today. And by the time we get all this oil embargo set, etc., Putin will have received over EUR 100 billion more in revenues. We are now in the worst of all worlds. Consumers are paying higher prices, but these high prices are sufficiently high that Putin gets higher revenues than before, more than compensated for the loss of volume. And some say nothing else can be done, and this is false. There is a clear solution which will collapse Russian revenue, incentivise substitution, protect consumers and even, Ms von der Leyen, increase EU resources. What is this miracle? It is the oldest trick in the book: a tariff. A tariff on Russian energy would allow us to shift some of the extra revenues from higher gas and oil prices to us, the consumers from the Russian producers. With a tariff, the price that European consumers pay will go up a little bit. Some consumers will continue consuming. Some of them will stop. It depends on how much needs they have. But the gap between the price that the consumers pay and what the Russians receive is actually the revenue from the tariff that would flow to the European taxpayers, the European Union, and that could be given back to Europeans to compensate for the higher gas prices. And the suppliers would be the ones facing the trouble, since a lower quantity is going to be supplied, it will be supplied at a lower price. Don’t forget that Russian oil and gas suppliers are desperately dependent on European purchases. Between us and our allies, we purchase 80% of the oil and gas and they will be willing to supply at the lower price that the tariff will involve for them.  Why? First, the EU and US are buying 80% of their fossil fuel exports and the infrastructure bottlenecks make it very hard to shift those exports to Asia. Second, production costs are low at USD 20 a barrel, so they will actually have to accept those lower revenues rather than shutting down the wells. In short, a tariff would allow us to shift Russian revenues to the European Union consumers, all while accelerating an end to European dependency on Moscow’s fuels. Even if a high tariff comes with a cost for the European Union, it is a more efficient way to stop Putin than any of the other sanctions that we already have in place before the embargo comes in as fast as possible. Let’s do it now. It must be a new tool in our armoury, enhancing our capacity to act.",

We must insist on mandatory standards and strong guarantees for their preservation, especially the right to privacy and data protection. We do not have to choose between our rights and our health. We must ensure ethical, transparent and secure use of these applications. Therefore, we need a European coordinated approach also ensuring European-wide interoperability.  Firstly, we must agree at a European level on privacy by design and data minimisation. Secondly, using such applications must be based on the explicit, freely given and informed consent. It should never be mandatory. We do not want immunity passports. We want to stop the virus from travelling. Thirdly, technology will not be effective without the trust of people. Citizens need to receive adequate and objective information on tracing contact policies, their content, their purpose and expected outcomes. Finally, the use and deployment of contact tracing applications must be subject to continuous and strict monitoring, technical evaluation and scientific scrutiny.

As you mentioned, Jytte can’t be with us this morning, but I would like to acknowledge the great work she did, together with all her colleagues and the shadow rapporteurs, precisely on this matter. Colleagues, I am one of those who strongly believes that today's intensive pesticide use around Europe is no longer sustainable. The unsustainable use of pesticides poses a challenge not only to our environment, but also to people's health, and it can have a serious impact on both the farmers who use such products and the general public who can come into contact with hazardous chemicals found in pesticides in public areas such as parks and also school-yards. Now the Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive provides for a range of actions that can help Europe achieve a sustainable use of pesticides. But it is amply clear that Member States are not implementing this legislation in the proper manner. Instead, we are seeing a situation where the use of pesticides in Europe has been steadily increasing, since the 1990s. And funnily enough, despite awareness around the sustainability of agriculture and despite the development of pesticides that can be used at low doses, on average, we are seeing the use of pesticides has not decreased at all in recent years.  Whilst some progress was registered vis-à-vis checks on spraying equipment and in developing training courses and certification schemes on how to best spray pesticides, little progress has been made in promoting the uptake of alternative techniques.  Moreover, there is a lack of clear and quantifiable targets in the different Member States’ national action plans and most of these plans do not specify as yet how the targets or objectives are to be achieved. We strongly feel that progress is also lacking in the field of integrated pest management.  Now, we need Member States to take this seriously, because European citizens are getting increasingly concerned and want dependency on pesticides to decrease.  Europe's farmers have every right to be able to use substances and techniques that do not put their own health at risk and that do not impact negatively on the environment and their farmland. We need incentives that can change things, incentives that can help farmers reduce the amount of pesticides they use and switch to more sustainable non-chemical options. For the S&D Group it is a priority that the European Union and all its Member States increase their efforts to help the sustainable use of pesticides. We need to continue working tirelessly to create non-toxic environments where we ensure that human health and ecosystems are fully protected against the impact of today's wide use of pesticides.  We have the tools. Now we need to make sure that Member States deliver, so that farmers, consumers, citizens and the environment, can all benefit from the existing sustainable alternative methods.  A better implementation of the Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive is key in ensuring that this change actually happens.  Finally, I know that there was very good cooperation between the responsible shadow rapporteurs, and on behalf of Jytte, I would like to thank all the colleagues from the different political groups for their constructive approach and valuable support for Jytte’s work. Later on today, we as parliamentarians have the opportunity to send a clear and important signal to all the Member States, that we stand together with all citizens across the European Union and expect our countries to ramp up their actions and contribute concretely to a more sustainable use of pesticides around Europe.",

They are winning the propaganda war. If you look to our social media for the moment, what you see is more and more posts echoing the narrative of the Kremlin. And the narrative of the Kremlin is that this is a war that was started by us to punish Russia. And that everything that is happening with the energy crisis today is not the consequence of the war, but the consequence of the sanctions and the measures we are taking.  And I know that there is an aid package – Mr Schinas, you have said here everything that needs to be done, but in the aid package, there is nothing about that. In the aid package is a package where we increase the sanctions against Russian individuals from 1232 to 1262, 30 more, mainly people who are involved in the referenda in eastern and south Ukraine. But nearly nothing about the celebrities, the influencers, the opinion leaders, the propagandists.  Already on 29 June we sent, together with the Navalny Foundation, a list of 135 people that are the core of the propaganda machine of Putin to the External Action Service. And you know how many have been sanctioned? Two of them! And since the aid package, four more. We are at six now of this 135. One is Dugin, for evident reasons, and three musicians, three singers. That is what we have done, six in total.  So my question is: if it is all true, what you are saying, why are the Commission and the Council not going after the core of the propaganda machine, tackling the 135 people in Russia?  And secondly, if we talk about countering Putin, and the Putin propaganda machine inside our own European Union, let us not make agreements, government agreements and government coalitions with the cheerleaders of Putin like Mr Salvini or Mr Berlusconi even. But Mr Salvini was even better with his T-shirt on the Kremlin showing his support for Putin.

Spain begs Morocco to keep them away, not caring if they are beaten up or dumped in the desert. And the EU strongly supports this practice, without any guarantee that migrants are being protected. The Commissioner puts the blame on the smugglers, but sealing off the borders, not offering legal pathways, makes refugees dependent on smugglers. So who should we blame here?

But I think we mainly have to thank our citizens who were at the core of the question of a European Citizens’ Initiative on the right to water, for universal access to water, and I think there we did make good steps despite, I have to say, the Council not really being willing to improve access to water for vulnerable and marginalised groups, because it all had to stay optional. I think it’s thanks to Parliament that we strengthened those provisions.  I think it’s also a good deal if you look at the improvements on, for example, endocrine disrupters, microplastics, and how we are, for the first time, dealing with a group approach on PFAs, so I think that is a good solution, but we also have to discuss the fitness check of the Water Framework Directive.  I think it’s very important that the Commission is stating also here that the Water Framework Directive is fit for purpose and that the Commission is not intending a review, and I think that is something that also this Parliament is asking for. However, still the conclusion is that half of our waters – and in some cases even less than half of our waters – are not in good condition and this means we need to improve on the implementation – and this is also a question for the Commission.  You said, Commissioner, that you will continue, but can you be more precise on what the Commission is going to do to increase the implementation, the pressure on Member States, to implement the Water Framework Directive?

The European Commission is determined to protect fundamental rights, as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, including the respect for human dignity, equality and non-discrimination. There is no place for violence in Europe, as there is no place for racism anywhere in the world.  With regard to anti—Roma racism, the EU Roma Strategic Framework for Equality, Inclusion and Participation, adopted last October, puts particular emphasis on the fight against discrimination and anti-gypsyism, along with the effective participation of Roma civil society. This is essential in the process of advancing the agenda on Roma equality, inclusion and participation at all levels and stages of policymaking, from the preparation of national Roma inclusion strategies through their implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Moreover, all Member States shall be reminded of the 2021 Council recommendation that, among others, encourages all Member States to adopt and implement measures to effectively fight direct and indirect discrimination, including by tackling harassment, as well as anti-gypsyism, stereotyping, anti-Roma rhetoric, hate speech, hate crime and violence against Roma.

Despite the European Commission’s limited competences in this particular case, my services have immediately established contacts with the Czech authorities, who convened a meeting of the Government Council for Roma Minority Affairs on 30 June 2021. The Commission called for an independent and thorough investigation by the competent Czech authorities. I took note that the Deputy Public Defender of Rights, Ms Monika Šimůnková, launched an independent investigation. I appreciate the efforts to properly investigate the case, and I wait with great expectation the results of this investigation.  More generally, as regards equality bodies, these national bodies are essential in ensuring that individuals and groups facing discrimination can enjoy their rights in full. They should be able to effectively perform the tasks assigned to them under EU legislation. The current EU law leaves a wide margin of manoeuvre to Member States on the powers and functioning of equality bodies. This results in major differences between national equality bodies, and many of them struggle with different levels of independence resources and competences. The Commission commits to strengthening equality bodies by adopting a legislative proposal on standards for equality bodies by the end of 2022. The standards would cover, among others, the equality bodies’ mandate, powers independence and resources. I can only assure you that, as Commissioner for Equality, I will continue working together with the Member States and do my utmost to deliver the commitment towards non—discrimination and Roma inclusion.  Thank you for your attention and I look forward to your interventions. ",

        "speech": " President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, I would like to thank you for inviting me to represent the Council in this very topical debate. Climate change is a direct and existential threat that spares no country. The world is already witnessing multiple devastating impacts of climate change. Stepping up global action is therefore more urgent than ever in light of the latest scientific data, especially the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Scientific evidence shows that human-induced global warming has already reached 1°C above pre—industrial levels and is rising at 0.2°C per decade. Without stepping up international climate action, the global average temperature increase could reach 2°C soon after 2060 and continue to rise afterwards. In addition, climate change is increasingly contributing to the deterioration of global biodiversity, water resources and ecosystems. The Arctic is warming at more than twice the global average rate, which is already having serious global, regional and local consequences. However, according to United Nations reports, the nationally determined contribution submitted by parties to the Paris Agreement collectively falls far short of what is required to achieve the long-term goals of the Agreement. Although insufficient progress has been made until now, I see growing momentum for more ambitious action. It is a positive sign that there is increasing knowledge, awareness and concern about climate change and its effects on the world at large. It is particularly encouraging to see that civil society and citizens, especially the youth, are calling for more ambitious action. While human-induced climate change is caused by the way in which our societies have produced and consumed goods during the industrial age up to the present day, the engagement of the young people of today is vital if we want to implement those changes that will ensure that the planet will be fit to live in for future generations. The Climate Action Summit last month was another welcome initiative to mobilise and boost the political will to step up collective efforts in line with the Paris Agreement. It is that shared awareness and collective will to effect change among governments, businesses and society as a whole that is needed in order to bring about the kind of paradigm shift and transformations of economies and societies that are needed to avert catastrophic climate change. The European Union is determined to help raise global ambition and lead the way. It continues to successfully decouple its economic growth from its emissions. From 1990 to 2017 the EU’s economy grew by 58%, while total greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 22%. The EU is set to overachieve its target for greenhouse gas reductions by 2020. It also has a complete package of legislation in place to ensure that it will reach its target for 2030 and thus also deliver its contribution to the Paris Agreement. However, we know that the policies that the EU has in place today will not be enough when we consider the scale of reductions needed in order to reach the long-term temperature goals of the Agreement. Therefore, rapid and far—reaching economic and societal transformation will be required in the coming decades. To this end, as is required of all parties, the EU will submit a long-term strategy for greenhouse gas emissions reductions with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change by 2020. With a view to preparing the European Union’s long-term strategy, the Council has been discussing since November last year how to achieve climate neutrality in line with the Paris Agreement, based on the Commission’s strategic long—term vision – a Clean Planet for all.  The scale of the economic and societal transformations needed in order to achieve climate neutrality in the EU will require efforts from all sectors of the economy. This is why it is so important that this debate is as broad, inclusive and extensive as possible across the EU and its Member States. The transition will affect everyone and it must be carefully managed to ensure that it’s just and socially balanced for all citizens. We need to take into account the specificities of Member States and different regions, ensuring that no one is left behind. On the other hand, the transition also offers great opportunities and potential for economic growth, new jobs and technological development to realise that potential investment into research and innovation needs to be scaled up, while ensuring that our industry is protected from competitive pressures in the global context.  Most Member States agree with the objective of climate neutrality in the EU by 2050 and several Member States have already set national targets contributing to that goal. We are continuing to work towards an agreement that all Member States can sign up to and look forward to the European Council finalising its guidance on the EU’s climate neutral vision before the end of 2019.

Such safeguards can only be achieved with a wide collaboration of all stakeholders such as policymakers and technology companies.

I don’t remember that those colleagues that protested today are protesting when they are part of the compromise. So when there is a compromise, it can be voted first – and that’s what we should do.  I’m very grateful to everybody that worked so hard to bring us to a position in which we have brought compromises now. What is ahead of us is the biggest piece of climate legislation that we have ever had. If we agree on it, we will save more CO2 in the next eight years than we did since 1990 – and we are really leading the way. But to do that, we also need to look at competitiveness and jobs. That’s why some of the amendments that have been negotiated are also important to give the industry the necessary time to adjust.  What we are doing – and I’m heading here on the speaker that asked for a postponement – is that we give industry and citizens more breathing space in this difficult time. We give less ambition until 2026, but then we catch up.  One thing should be clear, it’s a hard time now, and we need to use more coal to replace Russian gas. But the future is for renewables and energy efficiency and clean technologies, and that’s why we are doing the right thing to take into account the crisis but also taking care of our planet and the future of our children and grandchildren.",

        "speech": " Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, in the face of rising tensions and polarisation, more than ever, the European Union must reaffirm its commitment to protecting fundamental rights, the rule of law and democracy, both within and outside its borders. In this context, respect for freedom of thought, conscience and religion is among the core values we must defend. The European Commission is committed to ensuring the protection of these rights, which are expressed in Article 10 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The Commission is committed to protecting members of all religious groups from intimidation, discrimination, violence or attack, as well as from persecution. The Commission is also committed to promote intercultural and inter-religious dialogue as a way to promote tolerance and equal rights for all. Freedom of religion or belief is an essential feature within our Union, but of our external human rights policy as well. And the EU guidelines on the promotion and protection of freedom of religion or belief reflects our commitment to this freedom abroad. The implementation of these guidelines on freedom of religion and beliefs remains a priority of the EU’s external action. The appointment of Mr Frans van Daele as Special Envoy for the promotion of freedom of religion or belief outside the EU is the expression of our commitment to protect the victims of acts of violence based on religion or belief worldwide. This appointment also reflects our commitment to promote engagement with all stakeholders, public authorities, civil society, and religious or non-confessional organisations to address the rights of believers and non-believers. The line with all our partners across the world is clear. We consistently condemn discrimination, intolerance, violence and persecution against or by any person based on grounds of religion or belief. We call on all countries to protect the right for everyone to have or not have a religion or belief, to manifest or to change their religion or belief, while condemning the criminalisation of apostasy and abuse of the blasphemy laws. We condemn attacks against places of worship and persecution and discrimination against people of all faiths as well as non-believers. We also strongly condemn discrimination or violence perpetrated in the name of religion, in particular violence against women or against LGBTI persons. The instrumentalisation of religion must be rejected, and many religious leaders around the world are standing against such instrumentalisation. This is also why intercultural or inter-religious dialogue must be further promoted. Religious tolerance is essential to establish civil peace. This dialogue must also be pursued with a human rights perspective, ensuring respect of freedom of religion or belief, freedom of expression and other human rights and fundamental freedoms. In promoting freedom of religion or belief, the EU will continue to cooperate with the United Nations, which is setting universal standards applicable to all countries. We continue to draw attention as appropriate to freedom of religion or belief in the Universal Periodic Review of the UN Human Rights Council. We support the mandate of the United Nations Special Rapporteur and yearly resolutions in relevant United Nations human rights fora. We have raised our concerns in 20 human rights dialogues that we hold with partner countries. The EU has also taken several initiatives to foster freedom of religion and beliefs at local level, including involving civil society actors, faith-based organisations, humanists, atheists and religious actors. We are also providing concrete support to freedom of religion or belief through the EU’s human rights and civil society programmes. Honourable Members, our objective is clear: there is no place for intolerance, intimidation, discrimination, attack, persecution or violence in the name of religion or belief inside or outside the European Union. We remain fully committed to the protection and promotion of freedom of religion or belief for all.",

Keeping in mind the negative recent and current developments in the South Caucasus, EU support and guidance is extremely needed at this time.

Having little to say in scientific and technological competition, Russian leaders, supported by many ordinary people, want other nations to feel fear.  Then there is a personal obsession of their leader who would like very much to rebuild something similar to the Soviet Union. Aggression against Ukraine is a step in this direction. This is a major violation of law. Aggressors are responsible for a terrible number of killed people, demolished cities and villages, bombarded infrastructure. To hide compromising battle failures, they decided to officially steal part of Ukraine and threaten the rest of the world with the use of nuclear arms.  We all, not only Europeans, must understand that this is equal to the final termination of life on Earth. Giving up is not an option. It will not stop Russia.

        "speech": " President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, thank you for this opportunity to discuss in a bit more detail these two important upcoming summits, to which President Michel and President von der Leyen have already referred. First, on the G7 summit, which the UK will host in Cornwall this weekend, as President Charles Michel has just underlined, the overall mission of the EU for the meeting is clear: to support an agenda for global action built on a strong commitment to international cooperation, multilateralism and an open, resilient, rules-based international order.  Here there are a couple of elements. First, the COVID—19 pandemic needs global cooperation in order to be overcome. We need solidarity. We need to ensure early access to vaccines and treatments everywhere. While vaccination campaigns are making progress around the world, more needs to be done. President von der Leyen explained clearly what we are doing in terms of exports, donating vaccines, and supporting the production of vaccines, but more needs to be done. We need a stronger multilateral response. We call for closing the financial gap for access to the COVID—19 Tools Accelerator, and we have been the main supporters of COVAX, but we cannot be multilateralists alone. All the advanced G7 economies should share doses through COVAX.  Secondly, solidarity also remains key in dealing with the economic effects of the pandemic, as we expect uneven recoveries and deepening of inequalities. We need to work together to fight hunger and poverty around the world. In this respect, a new general allocation of special drawing rights, unprecedented in terms of size, is under preparation by the IMF. EU Member States have supported this initiative and are discussing how best to channel these resources to the most vulnerable countries.  Thirdly, we also need to better prepare the world for the next pandemic. A number of initiatives are ongoing with the recent Rome Declaration of Principles released by the Global Health Summit and discussed at WHO, including on an international treaty on pandemics. This should not be a missed opportunity. Furthermore, the UK G7 Presidency has put forward a very ambitious agenda on climate and biodiversity against the background of the two important events of this year, the COP26 on climate and the COP15 on biodiversity.  Success at the COP26 will depend on the level of ambition of all parties. The EU has already submitted its ambitious nationally determined contribution (NDC). It will be important that the G7 shows an equally strong level of ambition and leadership, with clear commitments. The EU is also committed to working with the G7 partners to adopt new, ambitious global targets on biodiversity for the COP15. Our own EU 2030 biodiversity strategy is a testimony to that.  Finally, another very important topic regards international taxation. We are at a crucial juncture on the OECD—led negotiation for a broader overhaul of the rules on international taxation of the largest multinational enterprises. We welcome the fact that the G7 has reached a consensus on the framework for an overall agreement, and we hope that this agreement at G7 level will indeed form a good basis for further work, both within the G20 and at the level of the OECD. Turning now to the upcoming summit with the United States, I would like to stress the symbolic importance of this event. It will take place as a part of President Biden’s first foreign trip, seven years after the previous summit, upon an invitation by President Charles Michel. The United States and the EU represent 780 million people who share democratic values. It is also the largest economic relationship in the world. We have a chance and a responsibility to help people make a living, keep them safe, fight climate change and stand up for democracy and human rights.  We would like to see this summit agree with the US on an ambitious cooperation agenda in four key areas: fighting the COVID pandemic and driving forward a sustainable global recovery; second, protecting our planet and fostering green growth; third, strengthening trade, investment and technological cooperation; and fourth, building a more democratic, peaceful and secure world. We expect that leaders will agree on a very concrete and ambitious set of deliverables in all these four areas and we believe that this event has the potential to be a key milestone in renewing and re—energising our partnership.  A strong transatlantic partnership is vital to ensure, and to contribute to, our common security, stability and prosperity. A renewed transatlantic agenda is necessary to find joint answers to global challenges and make it deliver for our citizens. We hope that the summit will not be a one—off event and that regular exchanges between the EU and the United States will resume at different levels. Discussions in preparation for the summit are under way, both with EU Member States and on the US side, and I am sure that today’s exchange will provide a timely and important input into the summit preparations. I’m very keen to listen to your views. Thank you very much for your attention. ",

        "speech": " Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, the war in Syria is now in its ninth year. It is the most severe humanitarian catastrophe and security crisis; it is unfolding right now in the north-west of the country, and in other parts of Syria we continue to see instability and dramatic human suffering.  Last Thursday, we heard the United Nations Special Envoy Geir Pedersen and the Head of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Mark Lowcock briefing the United Nations Security Council on the situation in Idlib. They described how regime forces led by Russia and Iran are launching heavy military offensives with no regard for the civilian population or civilian infrastructure. ‘We appear to have lost sight of the principle of proportionality’, the United Nations Special Envoy said. The intensification of military operations in Idlib has resulted in the indiscriminate killing of hundreds of civilians. Attacks continue on civilian targets in densely populated areas, on medical facilities and settlements for internationally displaced people. These are blatant and serious violations of international humanitarian law. There has to be accountability for those responsible. Since military operations began in Idlib in February 2019, one year ago, more than one million people have been displaced towards Turkey – we are talking about one million displaced people in one year – and every day more Syrians are fleeing the fighting and another wave of refugees is quite possibly in the making.  We also see clashes between the Syrian regime and Turkish forces, plus the risk of Turkish and Russian militaries confronting each other. These tensions could in turn trigger a wider regional conflict. The ceasefire agreed between Ankara and Moscow must be implemented. This is the situation.  Now, let me say this. After almost a decade of violence, the suffering of the Syrian people at the hands of the regime and its backers must cease. Too many people have died and those that are alive face a bleak future. The EU has major stakes in Syria, and in the surrounding region. We cannot afford more regional instability and another migrant crisis. We must avoid a resurgence of Daesh and other terrorist organisations on Europe’s doorstep.  The EU has a duty to preserve the rules-based international order, including the legitimacy of the United Nations Security Council. Yes, I know, we say that again and again, and we have to continue saying that. Recent military gains by the Syrian regime are not translating into stability. On the contrary, the Syrian regime will not bring peace and stability to Syria if it continues to pursue on military logic and the repression of its people. The economic situation is deteriorating rapidly, exacerbated by the banking crashes in Lebanon. The regime must change its behaviour.  We have stated from the very beginning that only a comprehensive and inclusive political solution, in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254, will allow sustainable peace and stability in Syria and the region. The EU will continue to support the efforts of United Nations Special Envoy Pedersen in relaunching the Constitutional Committee in Geneva. We also need to focus on other parts of this resolution, such as a nationwide ceasefire, the release of detainees, and making progress on the file of missing persons. Let’s recall that the European Union is, and remains, the largest humanitarian donor to Syria and its people, both inside, and to Syrian refugees and host communities in neighbourhood countries. We are supporting the resilience of ordinary civilians and civil society to maintain the social fabric of Syrian society. We are convinced that our support is a fundamental investment – it is not an expenditure, it is an investment – in the future of Syria and the region, which is part of our future, and as a partner of the global coalition to defeat Daesh the EU is conducting stabilisation projects in the north-east of Syria. We are always prepared to do more on all these lines of action, within the limits of our common red lines. These are: no normalisation with the regime, no risking of our funding being diverted to the regime or to the terrorists, and no reconstruction before a political process is firmly under way. We will continue to apply European Union sanctions targeting individuals and entities associated with the regime and responsible for its repressive and inhuman policies – and not the Syrian people. As I said before, the conflict in Syria is a geopolitical struggle. The European Union has a responsibility to lead for the sake of the Syrian people and to protect our own interests. While difficult, we must redouble our efforts to identify common interests with our other international stakeholders – Russia, the US, Turkey and others – and maybe I will have occasion to update on our discussions with Washington about this issue.

Yet success came at a price: a delay of the vaccination process itself.  I hope the vaccine shortage will be behind us quite soon. And still, we face two major problems. One is the mass reluctance of the people to vaccinate, and another is the staggering gap in the pace of vaccination campaigns in the different countries, where countries with completely different standards, like Bulgaria and the Netherlands, are both lingering behind due to mismanagement of the crisis. Therefore I call on the Commission to launch a pan-European campaign against disinformation, but also to actively intervene where national authorities fail to procure vaccines for their citizens. Some might argue it’s a national competence. I would answer that if it’s a common cause, if it’s a common fight, if we are to leave no one behind, then we should not leave behind those already left behind by their governments. ",

In this House last year we all signed up to the climate emergency. In this House, time and time and again, we signed up to climate neutrality in 30 years’ time. Now in the Climate Law we are going to act – and suddenly you see people getting nervous. Maybe they didn’t realise what they were signing up to because it was just a resolution. But that’s not how politics works. If you sign up to these targets you also have to translate it into a binding law, which we are discussing now for 2030.  Talking about science, it is very clear, and the United Nations Gap Report states very clearly, that if you want to maintain a chance on 1.5°, staying below that, the world needs to reduce by 67% – the world. This means an additional challenge for Europe. Maybe a last point on the challenges for industry. I also would like to hope that the EPP is a bit consistent, because we have been fighting international offsets under the Kyoto Protocol together and now I see amendments of the EPP Group bringing back these international offsets and further watering down the targets we are discussing.

        "speech": " President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, honourable Members, I’ve listened carefully to the honourable Mr Tang. Thank you for bringing this question to the plenary, as it is an important issue. The EU and its Member States are committed to strengthening good tax governance, fair taxation, global tax transparency and the fight against tax fraud and evasion, both at EU level and globally. The Ecofin Council produced a set of conclusions on 27 November 2020 on fair and effective taxation. This provided political guidance on further work on a modern EU tax environment. These conclusions also express the Council’s views on the Commission tax action plan, issued in July 2020, on good tax governance in the EU and beyond. The Council reiterated the importance of supporting the principles of good tax governance through the continuation of the successful work undertaken so far in the context of the Code of Conduct Group, including the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes, which should be further pursued and enhanced where necessary.  The Council therefore requested that the Code of Conduct Group continue its work. It also stressed the importance of fair treatment within the EU with respect to third countries and jurisdictions, while maintaining a continuous dialogue with third countries as well as with the OECD. The Code of Conduct Group will also pursue its discussions on ways and means to further improve the work on the code. This should take into account the successful lessons from other experience gained so far.  The EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes was revised most recently in October 2020 following an in-depth review of the implementation of the commitments made by third countries’ jurisdictions that are part of the process. The next revision of the EU list, which is scheduled for February at the Ecofin Council, is prepared by the Code of Conduct Group.  As regards defensive measures towards non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes, Member States and the Council adhere to a number of guiding principles. The defensive measures can have considerable consequences for the listed jurisdictions. The following aspects can be mentioned in this context. First, the key objective of the list is to ensure change, as Mr Tang said, and not punish the listed jurisdiction. Being listed entails reputational damage and we see that this aspect tangibly contributes to the efficiency of the EU list. More and more jurisdictions change their practice and adopt tax good governance; standards that are also applicable between the EU Member States.  So, on the second aspect, a number of EU-level defensive measures are being applied vis-à-vis the listed jurisdictions, and these can have financial consequences. The work in this area is also continuing with the assistance of the Commission.  And third, Member States are also free to apply national lists or defensive measures that go beyond what is agreed at the EU level or in the intergovernmental context of the Code of Conduct Group.  Finally, it is important to recall that the measures agreed in 2017 in the Council were reviewed in 2019 in the Code of Conduct Group, and Member States agreed to continue this work during this year. This reflects the fact that Member States have different legal systems, different laws and it takes time to design new measures. Work on defensive measures will not stop. Coordination will continue, and it’s likely to increase in the near future. Should the Commission choose to table a legislative proposal in this area, it will of course be examined by the Council in accordance with the treaty requirements and taking into account the limits of the EU’s competence in these matters.",

        "speech": " Präsidentin der Kommission. – Sehr geehrter Herr Präsident, Frau Ministerin, sehr geehrte Damen und Herren Abgeordnete! In Polen sind bis Anfang Februar 94 % des medizinischen Personals und 80 % der Bewohnerinnen und Bewohner von Altenheimen geimpft worden. In Dänemark sind es in den Altenheimen sogar 93 %. Und in Italien haben wir bis heute mehr als 4 % der Bevölkerung, die eine Impfung erhalten haben. Diese drei Beispiele zeigen, dass die Impfkampagne in Europa vielerorts an Fahrt aufgenommen hat. Insgesamt sind in Europa seit Dezember 26 Millionen Impfdosen ausgeliefert worden. Mehr als 17 Millionen Menschen wurden geimpft. Und wir werden so hart wie nur irgend möglich arbeiten, dass wir unser Ziel erreichen, nämlich, dass wir bis Ende des Sommers 70 % der erwachsenen Bevölkerung in Europa geimpft haben. Dennoch ist es eine Tatsache, dass wir heute beim Kampf gegen das Virus noch nicht da sind, wo wir sein wollen. Wir waren spät dran bei der Zulassung, wir waren zu optimistisch bei der Massenproduktion und vielleicht waren wir uns auch zu sicher, dass das Bestellte tatsächlich pünktlich geliefert wird. Wir müssen uns fragen, warum das so ist und welche Lehren wir daraus ziehen können. Aber lassen Sie mich dennoch zunächst mit drei Punkten beginnen, von deren Richtigkeit ich tief überzeugt bin: Es war richtig und es ist richtig, dass wir Europäerinnen und Europäer den Impfstoff gemeinsam bestellt haben und nun solidarisch teilen. Ich mag mir gar nicht ausmalen, was es bedeutet hätte, wenn einige wenige große Mitgliedstaaten sich Impfstoff gesichert hätten und der Rest leer ausgegangen wäre, was das für unseren Binnenmarkt bedeutet hätte und für die Einheit Europas. Es wäre wirtschaftlicher Unsinn und es wäre das Ende unserer Gemeinschaft. The second point I am deeply convinced of: the same solidarity must also be shown with our partners in our neighbourhood and across the world. This is also a matter of stopping the spread of the virus to reduce the likelihood of mutations. The access to vaccines for low- and middle-income countries is therefore as much about our own interest as it is about solidarity.  This is why we set up COVAX, the facility in which high-income countries can finance the access to vaccines for low- and middle-income countries. As Team Europe, that is the Member States and the European institutions, we have provided EUR 850 million, making us one of the biggest contributors to COVAX, and COVAX start delivering vaccines as of this month. And I am sure that this House will agree that we need more, because our responsibility extends far beyond Europe’s border.  Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, le troisième point que je voudrais soulever concerne notre approche et notre processus. Nous avons fait le choix de ne pas prendre de raccourcis en matière de sécurité ou d’efficacité. Nous assumons ce choix pleinement. Il n’y a pas de compromis à faire lorsqu’il s’agit d’injecter une substance biologiquement active chez une personne en bonne santé, et c’est pourquoi nous nous appuyons sur le processus de contrôle de l’EMA, notre agence européenne des médicaments. Oui, cela veut dire que l’approbation prend trois à quatre semaines supplémentaires. Ce temps supplémentaire est un investissement essentiel pour la confiance et la sécurité. Et oui, il y a également des leçons à tirer de ce processus et nous le faisons déjà. En premier lieu, nous devons améliorer le partage de données des essais cliniques avec l’EMA, c’est pourquoi nous lançons dès maintenant un nouveau réseau européen d’essais cliniques. En parallèle, notre commissaire de la santé, Stella Kyriakides, va travailler sur un cadre réglementaire pour permettre à l’EMA d’examiner les vaccins aussi rapidement que possible. Une autre leçon à tirer concerne la production de masse de vaccins. À juste titre, nous étions tous très concentrés sur le développement du vaccin, mais globalement, nous avons sous-estimé la difficulté liée à la production de masse. Il faut normalement cinq à dix ans pour produire un nouveau vaccin. Nous l’avons fait en dix mois. C’est une grande réussite scientifique. Nous devrions en être fiers. Mais en quelque sorte, la science a dépassé l’industrie. La production des nouveaux vaccins est un processus très complexe. Il n’est simplement pas possible de mettre en place un site de production du jour au lendemain. De plus, ces vaccins intègrent jusqu’à 400 composants et la production implique jusqu’à 100 entreprises. C’est pourquoi nous avons créé une task force pour accroître la production industrielle des vaccins sous l’autorité de Thierry Breton, notre commissaire en charge du marché intérieur. L’objectif est de détecter les problèmes et d’aider à les résoudre. L’industrie doit s’adapter au rythme de la science.  Indeed, industry has to match the groundbreaking pace of science. We fully understand that difficulties will arise in the mass production of vaccines, but Europe has invested billions of euros in capacities in advance and we urge the Member States to plan their vaccine rollout. So now we all need predictability and this is why we introduced the export transparency and authorisation mechanism. To be very clear, we do not intend to restrict companies that are honouring their contracts with the European Union and there is an automatic exemption for exports to the EEA countries, for the Western Balkans and the rest of our neighbourhood, for humanitarian needs and for the 92 low and middle—income countries covered by COVAX. So Europe is always ready to help, but we insist on our fair share.  As far as the mechanism goes, allow me a word on the island of Ireland. The bottom line is that mistakes were made in the process leading up to the decision, and I deeply regret that. But, in the end, we got it right, and I can reassure you that my Commission will do its utmost to protect the peace of Northern Ireland, just as it has done throughout the entire Brexit process.  Honourable Members, the battle against the virus is a marathon and not a sprint. It needs foresight, endurance and stamina. Almost every day we hear news of different variants and how contagious they are. We do not yet have the full picture when it comes to the effectiveness of treatments and vaccines on new strains, but we do know these variants will continue to emerge and we do know that we need to anticipate and prepare immediately.  This is why we are starting our new Health Emergency Response Authority (HERA) project now by launching our preparedness agenda against new variants next week. We need to adapt our regulations to this new challenge. We need rapid sequencing and clinical characterisation of new mutations, and we need systematic sample and data sharing across networks and labs because, to defeat the virus, we need to know as much detail about it as possible.  In parallel, we will tackle a second challenge. As I said, we are dealing with completely new mRNA vaccines never manufactured at scale before. One of the current bottlenecks is, for example, linked to just two synthetic molecules. If we had just 250 grammes more of these molecules, companies say they could produce one million more doses of vaccine. This is why we need more coordination on the supply of key ingredients. We need to improve manufacturing surge capacity and we need to boost cooperation between the public and the private sector. This will be the core task of HERA because we must ensure that, despite future mutants, we will be safe next winter and beyond.  We all know that the information we have on the virus and the vaccines can change by the hour, and this is why we will set up a contact group between the European Parliament and the Commission. I will do my utmost to ensure that you are able to scrutinise all the contracts we have signed because I know that trust needs transparency.  Meine sehr geehrten Damen und Herren Abgeordnete, wir alle geben unser Bestes im Kampf gegen das Virus – in den Familien, in den Städten und Gemeinden, in den Mitgliedstaaten und auf der europäischen Ebene. Und das sollten wir uns gegenseitig nicht absprechen. Wir werden diese Herausforderungen nur bewältigen, wenn wir zusammenhalten. Unser gemeinsamer Feind, das ist das Virus. Es lebe Europa!",

There are many good people in the EPP, true Democrats and defenders of the rule of law, but, as long as Fidesz is a member of the EPP, the EPP is complicit in the destruction of democracy and the rule of law.

These legislative proposals that are on the table – I hope they will get a majority, all of them, because we need certainly stronger rules to deliver on our climate ambitions and our energy independence ambitions.  Some of you have talked about whether this Energy Efficiency Directive is binding, to which degree it is binding. Well, for the first time, we have an Energy Efficiency Directive which is binding for the EU as a whole. Previous directives on energy efficiency have not been binding. They have been indicative. Also for Member States individually, they will have to deliver on these measures that are in the Directive. They will have to make plans and show how they can increase energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption.  We have actually, in this Directive, given the Commission, the tools to, if Member States do not act, if they are falling behind and they are not showing how they will catch up on energy savings, then the Commission has the mandate to infringe them and to take them to court. I think this is an important part of the Directive. We don’t wish for anyone to be taken to court, but we wish and mean that this Directive needs to be implemented.  Everybody, all the Member States need to take it serious. They need to increase the energy efficiency, and if they do not, well, there can be legal consequences. I think that is important because we have seen that in previous efforts have not been sufficient. Actually, we are not delivering on our ambitions as it is right now. So we need to take more actions, and I think I am convinced that this Directive will lead to exactly that point.",

When workers are empowered to shape decisions, we know that productivity, innovation and working methods improve. Good governance requires more democracy at work, and strong trade unions are playing a key role related to health and safety measures, in job retention schemes and organising new trends like telework. So empowering trade unions also strengthens social Europe. Reinforcing the European Works Council Directive when it comes to the right to information and consultation for representatives of employees – and particularly, as we heard yesterday again, during restructuring processes – is an absolute necessity and an incredible tool to strengthen the role of employees vis—à—vis employers in policy—making on the daily life cycle of the company. The recast directive on the European Works Council failed in its original objectives. Indeed, employers can easily stall or completely block the establishment of a European Works Council. European Works Councils are often informed after final decisions have already been taken and transnational and confidentiality clauses are too often misused. So it is now time to solve this issue with legally binding changes by ensuring timely and meaningful consultation; clarifying the scope of confidentiality; improving dispute resolution; introducing effective, dissuasive and proportionate penalties, but also by granting access to justice for the representatives of workers and securing resources and access to trade union experts and support. Companies have to show their willingness to work in close cooperation with their workforce and the unions in order to make the digital and green transition a success for all. The implementation of the European Works Council Directive has been ongoing for 15 years already, without enough concluding results and successes. The European Commission can no longer hide behind case studies and recommendations. It is time to deliver now and to turn this report into concrete legislative proposals. Dennis Radtke and the shadow rapporteurs did a fantastic job. Thank you so much, Dennis, for having invited so many participants who know how it works on the ground.

So a revision is really badly needed, and I hope that the revision will make it harder for Ireland to take its usual ‘softly softly’ approach to multinationals. But I also hope that the revision will take into account the situation of retired workers, who are often overlooked, and whose pension rights can become eroded and affected by discussions that don’t involve them.  We say that the role of works councils is to make sure that workers have a say when it comes to decisions made by far—away management. This principle has to apply to retired workers.  I’m struck by the situation of airport workers in Ireland whose pensions were decimated on the basis of discussions that they had no input into. They worked all their lives, made their contributions, and their income was taken away. This is wrong. We have an opportunity to correct it here. Let’s hope we take it!",

They hold vast amounts of data which they now must manage with utmost responsibility and in full alignment with EDPS. They receive new investigative powers for which they are accountable in terms of respecting procedural rights. For that, they’ll have a human rights officer in their ranks who must be given the space and the resources to perform his or her role properly. I therefore call on Europol and on the Commission as the guardian of our rules in the EU to take these new functions very seriously, to internalise the duty of care they have towards our European citizens and the scrutiny they owe towards this Parliament that represents them.",

But to be fair, this is not just a right—wing problem.

        "speech": " Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, 75 years ago, the guns of the Second World War in Europe fell silent. The Nazi regime was defeated, but Europe lay in ruins. Just five years later, on 9 May 1950, Robert Schuman made a declaration that would profoundly change this continent and would put it on a path that no one could have anticipated. For me, this is a very special moment. Seventy years ago, Robert Schuman started a journey, step by step. He showed us the way and the direction. And today, here we are. Just seven days ago, at the EU—Western Balkans Summit, we laid the ground for reuniting the Western Balkans with our union, reuniting Europe’s history with its geography. Yes, today, our union faces its greatest challenge yet: a pandemic that knows no borders, a pandemic that threatens our lives and our way of life, a pandemic that has tested our union to its core. But, as so often in history, this crisis has also shown Europe’s greatest strengths: our commitment to unity, born of common values and shared history, and our solidarity with those in need. Schuman’s words resonate today more strongly than ever before: ‘it is no longer a time for vain words, but for a bold, constructive act’. The Schuman Declaration embodied the perfect balance, the delicate dance between idealism and pragmatism, without which there would be no European Union and no European solidarity as we know it today. He famously said, ‘Europe will not be made all at once according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity.’ This crisis has put that solidarity to the hardest of tests. In March, some even said that we would not pass these tests. But, if you look around the world today, Europe has become the beating heart of solidarity: French patients treated in German hospitals, Polish doctors and Romanian nurses working in Italy, and a huge recovery plan is in the making. The world is watching. Our European model will only mean something to the world if we show solidarity within our union’s borders, to each other, and beyond, with our partners globally.  Since the pandemic began, the European Union has been working on all fronts to contain the spread of the coronavirus, support health systems, protect and save lives, and counter the socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic, with historically unprecedented measures at both national and EU level. The Commission will directly support the healthcare systems of EU countries with EUR 3 billion from the EU budget, matched with EUR 3 billion from the Member States to fund the Emergency Support Instrument and the rescEU common stockpile of equipment. The rescEU initiative helps secure vital equipment, from ventilators to personal protective equipment, and to mobilise medical teams for assistance to the most vulnerable, including in refugee camps. The first hosting state of this stockpile is Romania.  The production of the first ventilators has started, and some 330 000 protective masks were delivered to Spain, Italy and Croatia in the past weeks. Since the beginning of the outbreak, thanks to the EU Civil Protection Mechanism and consular protection coordination, the European Union has brought home over half a million citizens stranded all over the world. Thanks to the Emergency Support Instrument, the European Union has procured another 10 million masks, the first 1.5 million of which have already been delivered to 17 Member States.  I want to thank this House for having launched the ‘Europeans Against COVID—19’ campaign. This Europe Day, the Commission and the Council joined forces with you, and we all pay tribute to those who are making history today, the everyday heroes fighting the coronavirus in our hospitals, in research labs, or by delivering personal protective equipment to those in need, because we know that coronavirus knows no borders.  Tackling this pandemic is a global challenge and the EU is leading the global effort to develop and deploy effective diagnostics, treatments and a vaccine. Without this tool, every country in the world remains vulnerable. Countries and international organisations are joining forces to develop these tools and put the structures in place that ensure they are universally available and affordable. How wealthy a country is should not determine whether its people get to live without this virus.  That is why President von der Leyen launched an international pledging marathon on 4 May. So far, we have raised EUR 7.4 billion, and this includes a pledge of EUR 1.4 billion from the Commission. But we know that more is needed and I am confident it will come. The crisis gives us an opportunity to lead by example and to reach for our highest aspirations, even when, in the short term, it might be easier to give in to our lowest instincts.  We will be remembered tomorrow for how we act today. Therefore, this crisis forces us to reflect. The pandemic will have a lasting effect, not just on the global system, but also on our daily lives. It is vital that on our path to recovery, we reach out, engage and listen to citizens, at European, national, regional and local level.  The Conference on the Future of Europe is an ideal forum for that and should commence as soon as conditions allow it. The Conference, as a pan—European democratic exercise, can reinforce the link between European citizens and the institutions. It can help rebuild trust and solidarity, even in the new coronavirus reality. The context might have changed, but our determination has not. We want the Conference on the Future of Europe to give citizens a greater say in shaping future EU policies, and we want this to be a joint exercise, involving the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on an equal footing. That is also why any decision on when to launch the Conference must be a joint one taken by all three institutions. Given the circumstances, my colleague and friend, Vice—President Šuica, who is leading the Commission’s efforts on the Conference, is following this debate remotely from Croatia. She is very much looking forward to joining the debates in this House in a physical mode as soon as possible. In order to be ready for the launch of the Conference under the containment measures scenario, the Commission is exploring digital solutions to enable us to host virtual debates and dialogues. We are working on a multilingual digital platform, allowing citizens to share their results and promote interactive ways for public engagement as part of the Conference. Such a digital platform would be open to all EU institutions. But a digital solution alone cannot reach everyone and cannot compensate for the real deal: face—to—face town hall discussions and workshops across the continent, reaching people from all walks of life. To protect the health of our citizens, we need to be patient and plan accordingly, step by step. Once the Council has adopted its mandate, we will get there. I am confident that the next step, the joint declaration by the Parliament, the Commission and the Council, which is necessary to launch the Conference, is within reach.  A little more than 30 years ago, I was looking through the barbed wire of the infamous Iron Curtain to Austria. This fence was just two kilometres from our apartment and I passed it every single day. I could see the people, the houses and the lights on the other side of the Danube, but I was told by my father that I would never be able to cross the border. Therefore, for me, the Schuman Declaration celebration is also a celebration of the European dream and freedom. I am sure that Robert Schuman would be proud today of how much we have accomplished. But I am also convinced that he would push us higher and further. Therefore, let’s respond to his inspiration by building an even fairer, greener, freer and stronger Europe. (Applause) ",

        "speech": " Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, President of the European Council, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I have pleasure in addressing you today on behalf of the President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, who is, as I am sure you are aware, in preventive self-isolation. There is a question that is on every European’s mind today: when will the pandemic finally pass? No one has the answer. The second wave has come. Infections are rising at a worrying speed again and our Member States again have to take action to contain the second wave and eventually to stop it. Since the first wave hit us, Europe has achieved a lot. Let me just name our main strands of work: vaccines, European coordination and our resilience to prevent future crises. First, progress on vaccines. We now have three contracts in place with pharmaceutical companies and three more are being finalised. This means that, if they manage to develop a vaccine, there will be doses reserved for Europeans. It also means that all Member States will get a future vaccine on the same terms and at the same time. Last week, the European Commission delivered a vaccination plan, a European framework on who should get the vaccine first. Our vaccination plan is based on science and on common sense. Health workers will take precedence. High on the list will also be people over 60, people at risk because of their health and of course essential workers, people who cannot socially distance and people who are disadvantaged because of their socioeconomic background. We want to protect these people because it’s not only a matter of social justice. We believe it’s the smartest way to ease the pressure on our health system and slow down contagion. Second, progress on European coordination. Last week, the Council adopted the Commission’s proposal on colour codes and data exchange. This means that all Member States are now speaking the same language when it comes to their citizens’ health and it means clarity for people who need to travel across the border. It is now essential to implement these decisions in full and it is also essential to agree on common rules on testing and quarantine. From Spain to Sweden, we are all facing the same disease so our precautions against it should also be the same. But we are also aware that we still have a long way to go. It will be months before a vaccine is found and distributed. We must be very disciplined and help everyone to contain the spread of the virus as much as possible in the coming weeks and months. If we fail to do so, we run the risk not only of losing the achievements in the area of health protection, but we are also risking Europe’s economic recovery, which we launched with great effort before the summer break. No one in Europe wants a second lockdown. People don’t want that and companies don’t want it either. That is why I call on European citizens to behave responsibly. Protect yourself and others. But there is also a lot at stake economically in other areas. The President of the European Council, Charles Michel, has just touched upon them, namely our negotiations with the United Kingdom and our climate target for 2030. Let me first update you on our negotiations with the UK. The deal we are trying to achieve would be absolutely unprecedented. This was the will of the EU and the UK when agreeing on the scope of the future partnership in our joint political declaration and it is still our will. No other economy is as closely aligned to ours as the British economy. It is only natural after almost 40 years as a part of the single market. UK companies produce the same products, within the same value chains, and with almost no transport costs to reach our market. We need to ensure that the European Union and the United Kingdom’s companies face fair competition on the EU market. This is why we have put so much emphasis on ensuring a level playing field and on governance and conflict resolution.  Together with fisheries, these are the main outstanding issues where we are still far apart. On each of these issues, we still have to test whether it is possible to find common ground with our British friends. This needs hard work. We have made it clear that we are ready to engage intensively to find solutions. There is no time to lose. Our objective is still to reach an agreement that will pave the way for a new fruitful relationship between the EU and the UK. We will continue to work for such an agreement, but not at any price. My good colleague and friend, Michel Barnier, will provide you with additional information on the subject. If you allow me, I will now turn to the Withdrawal Agreement, which must be fully operational as of 1 January 2021. Deal or no deal, the Withdrawal Agreement must be respected.  (Applause) It is not only a matter of trust, which is of course key, but also of political responsibility vis-à-vis our citizens and peace and stability on the island of Ireland. Therefore I welcome that, at the last Joint Committee meeting, we managed to strike a constructive approach. Now it will be vital that this translates into concrete workable operational solutions. Finally, let me say a few words on our climate ambitions. Two weeks ago, this Parliament voted for a very ambitious recommendation. The European Council has not yet reached an agreement on targets and percentages but, rest assured, the Commission will continue to push for Europe’s Heads of State and Government to unite behind an ambitious climate objective of at least 55% by 2030 and this agreement must come before the end of the year.  Last week, we presented two more stepping stones to pave the way towards 55%, the renovation wave and the methane strategy. Our next steps will include revision of the Emissions Trading System, the strategy for offshore wind, the revised regulation for the trans-European energy networks, the mobility strategy and the new proposal for the circular economy. We have a plan that can lead us to 55% and, thanks to Next Generation EU, we have the resources to turn it into reality. We know how we can achieve this goal, but it is also important to remind ourselves why we are doing it. We are going for at least 55% because this is the only way to contain global warming. We made a commitment in Paris and we want to keep our word, but we are also doing this because it makes sense economically. If we go for at least 55%, it will strengthen our first-mover advantage in clean technologies. Our companies will be the leaders in tomorrow’s markets. We will become less dependent on energy imports from the rest of the world. As we work here in Europe, they are also engaging on the global stage so that other countries match our ambition. Europe wants to lead the way and today many others are following our example but never forget that in the near future companies will compete on international markets based on who has the best green technologies. We have to increase the pace of green innovation to remain competitive. It is the right thing to do and the smartest choice as well. Fifty—five percent is an insurance on Europe’s future. I have to repeat and underline that it’s decision time. Europe must be ambitious for our planet, for our economy and for our next generation.",

Many thousands of students and young people in Wales, like elsewhere, have benefited from the opportunities that Erasmus offered. Our universities in particular have had the pleasure of hosting young people from across the European Union.  The Commission said we have to have ambition to empower young people. I believe we’ve achieved that here. From the start, one of the priorities of my group, the Greens/EFA Group, was to support the tripling of the budget to meet the target of tripling the number of people taking part, because that is ambition. I believe the new programme will be simpler, more open to all individuals from all education sectors and phases, and will help tackle many of the problems we face.  And finally, if we leave the EU, the loss of Erasmus to Wales would be a huge blow. That is why I am pleased that this report allows for the continued participation of third countries. You can be sure that given the opportunity, Wales will still be an active and enthusiastic partner, and that’s the positive message that I would like to leave with you. Diolch yn fawr iawn.

        "speech": "Mr President, Prime Minister Krišjānis Kariņš, welcome back to a parliament you know very well indeed. We’ve not always been of one mind on economic affairs, but I have always been very impressed by the strength of your commitment to our common European project, and again today was a testament to that. And actually you are quite typical of that commitment that you find in the Baltic republics. I believe that the three Baltics and the Benelux countries should cooperate much more deeply, because if they can find agreement between them, I think they could be bridge-builders and foster unity in Europe maybe better than the Franco-German duo, which seems to be a bit at odds at the moment. I liked very much your speech. I liked you reminding us that the European Union is a peace project solving differences through dialogue rather than sheer force. This is not just a justification for the past century. It is today’s justification for the European project. I liked very much the metaphor of the bundle. Like you, I come from a small country, but even big countries in Europe, as you said, are actually small as a yardstick globally. I liked very much also what you said about the single market. The single market is the ultimate free trade agreement. But it is very specific, because unlike all other free trade agreements, it is governed by democratic institutions: the European Parliament, the European Council. You don’t find that elsewhere in other free trade deals. I liked also very much the fact that you were upfront about money laundering, and I think that you found the right words, and we like to hear them, because I know that your commitment on that is very strong. However, I’d like also to beg to disagree, not necessarily with what you said, but with a number of positions and actions of the Latvian Government. First, for us Greens the European project must resolutely choose to be a leader: the engine of the ecological transition of our societies. If we can’t make them fit within the boundaries that nature sets us, it’s the survival of humankind that is at stake. It’s also a matter of leadership: if we Europeans don’t lead in that transition, others will, and we will be left with buying their solutions rather than providing ours to the rest of the world. One case in point, and you mentioned it, is agriculture. The common agricultural policy is the EU’s largest budget. We should make sure every euro-cent spent on it is used and contributes to the transformation of our agricultural model so that it reduces CO2 emissions and restores biodiversity and the quality of our soil. Arguably, the CAP predominantly promotes a productivist model that goes against these goals – and your government supports it – and actually you find it already too green for your taste. I understand that your country – and I agree with that – wants its fair share of the CAP. We are convinced, though, that the best chance of achieving that target is actually to fight for a greener CAP that moves away from the productivist model and to industrial farming. The second aspect relates to citizenship. You mentioned the European values, and actually if you read Article 2, the first value that is mentioned there is human dignity. Human dignity cannot be divided: it is for all, present and to come. Latvia’s history as an unwilling part of the Soviet Union has resulted in a significant part of your citizenship originating from former Soviet republics. While we understand that the wounds of the past cannot be ignored, we believe that, as a member of the EU, Latvia is strong enough not to keep more than 10% of its population stateless. Similarly, we believe that your country could and should do more to promote minority rights and fight discrimination, especially when it comes to age, disability or sexual orientation. Thirdly, we have welcomed – and again, today you managed to avoid this – the fact that all three Baltic republics have avoided the toxic grandstanding that we have seen on the topic of asylum and migration. I really appreciated your words on that. However, recently your government opposed any binding relocation scheme – which is actually the only way to organise European solidarity. It has also refused to sign the UN Global Migration Compact, which, contrary to the allegations of the national populists, is simply providing guidelines as to how to handle this challenge. You and I know that it is not legally binding and that it is grounded in values of state sovereignty, responsibility-sharing, non-discrimination and human rights, and it recognise that only a cooperative approach will allow us to meet this challenge. Latvia’s signature should be on that document. With the European elections now upon us, this is the last debate on the future of Europe in this European Parliament. Count on us to relentlessly defend the first-ever attempt at building a transnational democracy. But equally, count on us to make it work for everyone, by putting human dignity rather than short-term economic profits at the front and in the centre. A more just, more sustainable, more free and democratic Europe is what our citizens want. We will ask that they trust us to deliver just that.",

In return, they are allowed to use and to loot countries’ natural resources. The Wagner Group is present in this kind of business in half of Africa, rapidly expanding; new companies are mushrooming, and even private military and security companies (PMSCs) employed by Western governments have been involved in these kinds of crimes. So it’s time that we got this under control. We have to sanction – and very thoroughly sanction – these PMSCs, but also those who contract them, for being involved in these kinds of human rights abuses. We should no longer support governments that rely on the services of PMSCs that commit human rights violations.

The IMF and the World Bank released a report in 2018 stating that, up until that year, Nicaragua had a sustained outstanding growth in GDP, improved their social indicators, expanded tourism and provided regional leadership in public safety and sustainable energy and food sovereignty.  The violent US—backed coup in 2018 resulted in approximately 200 deaths on both sides, sanctions and the loss of 130 000 jobs. The National Endowment for Democracy and the CIA funded far—right criminals who plotted the death and destruction, and are the ones being hailed in here as political prisoners. A negative comment that we did hear from the Government was that they were too slow to prosecute these criminals. If you are so worried about democracy in here, before you go to Latin America maybe you should look at the Julian Assange case.  ",

The pandemic has somewhat hampered our mutual success, but we cannot allow it to undermine Ukraine’s achievements in the field of macroeconomic governance, for example. The EU’s MFA loans, COVID—19 response packages and technical assistance programmes should be commended and extended further to allow for the roll—out of vaccination programmes. However, we have to expect full respect for the provisions of the agreement with regard to regulatory approximation, increased efforts to fight corruption, stronger protection of property rights and guarantees of freedom of association and collective bargaining rights for workers. We should also urge our Ukrainian partners to create a predictable regulatory environment with an independent judiciary and limited influence of state—owned enterprises and oligarch—based interest groups, in order to attract much—needed foreign direct investment.

We so desperately need to ensure that collective EU mental health policies are put in place. Each of us are here today speaking about something like solidarity, and we’ve seen that it has worked. We’ve experienced the impact of working together in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the sharing of best practices between Member States, which resulted in sharing of medicines, and also an EU-wide financial support for all. We have the blueprint to get this right and it is essential now that we use this information collectively at EU level.  By supporting this report, you will join our call to the Commission to adopt an EU mental health strategy and deliver a European year dedicated to mental health next year in 2023. The EU year and mental health strategy will raise awareness of mental health policy. It will ensure debate in our institutions and across our Member States. And perhaps most importantly, it will change the prevailing attitudes towards mental health and well-being across our European Union.  I appeal to each and every one of you to join my group, the EPP, our online petition to further support our call to the Commission to dedicate a European year to mental health next year.  Colleagues, our citizens are dying in silence. We heard from many today, and that statistic cannot be put aside any more. For once and for all, we must remove the stigma around mental health.

        "speech": " Member of the Commission. – Madam President, school is out and summer is here. Europe is getting ready to travel again, reminding us all of the importance of freedom of movement and the importance of Schengen. Especially after this last year behind us, we all have missed that freedom so much.  Thirty percent of our citizens live in a border area, 1.7 million people live in one Schengen country and work in another, and 3.5 million people cross internal borders every day. Schengen is a unique area of freedom, security and justice. We will need Schengen to rebuild our economies. There’s no going back to Schengen, we can only go forward.  I wish to thank Tanja Fajon very much for telling me that the European Parliament is one of my important allies to achieve this goal. That is also shown in the report, Tanja Fajon, that you presented today and I warmly thank you for this report. Together, we must shape the future of Schengen. That is why, last year, President von der Leyen, speaking before this House, announced a new strategy for the future of Schengen, which we presented last month, building on two high—level political meetings on the Schengen Forum we organised since last November, with crucial input from Members of the European Parliament.  The Commission’s Schengen strategy is based on the idea that to move freely inside the Schengen Area we must ensure the security of our citizens. We must prioritise three essential things.  First, we must secure our external borders. To do that, we must implement the decisions we’ve already taken. Frontex’s new standing corps is being set up as we speak. It will support Member States at the most vulnerable places along our borders, benefiting the whole Schengen Area. We are building the most advanced external border management system in the world by launching the entry—exit system and the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) next year and achieving full interoperability by 2023. We have state—of—the—art information systems. It’s essential to link them up to stop criminals and terrorists and to keep track of third-country nationals.  Second, besides protecting our borders, we must protect our citizens inside our borders. That is why we have launched strategies, initiatives and proposals to fight the trafficking of drugs, guns and human beings, to fight child sexual abuse, terrorism and organised crime. We’ve launched proposals to improve police cooperation and law enforcement information exchange to boost the mandate of Europol. By the end of this year, we will present a police cooperation code to build permanent police partnerships.  Equally, we need to better manage migration. We have started to make good progress with the pact, with the adoption of the blue card and the political endorsement last week of the EU asylum agency. We need to continue progress step by step. Better managed migration will also make Schengen stronger.  Third, we must together take responsibility for the governance of the Schengen Area. The Schengen Forum will meet once a year to discuss key political decisions at high political level, supported by an annual state of Schengen report that the Commission will present later this year with the new Schengen scoreboard to keep track of progress. This will support our common work in the Schengen Forum. We have also proposed a stronger Schengen evaluation and monitoring mechanism to detect and solve problems sooner, as called for by this Parliament.  I’m confident that we can make very swift progress on this file, which is essential for mutual trust between Member States, trust we need to have in the Schengen Area. Later this year, the Commission will present a targeted revision of the new Schengen Borders Code to ensure that, when several Member States face a crisis, we have a response that is rapid, coordinated and European, and that internal border checks remain measures of last resort.  Together, we have learned the lessons of past crises. Since 2015, Schengen has faced challenges – migration, terrorism and, most recently, the pandemic – causing Member States to introduce internal border checks. Secondary movements are a real issue, but internal border checks have not solved the problem and will not help us to manage migration. Our new Pact on Migration and Asylum is a much better instrument to manage migration.  Criminals and terrorists are a real threat, but internal border checks alone are not what will stop criminals and terrorists. We can only stop them by joining forces with better police cooperation and state—of—the—art ICT systems. The virus is a real danger, but internal border checks have not, and will not, stop the virus. Only coordinated action will help us to get out of this crisis.  So let us now move forward on Schengen together. Let the start of summer, the summer of 2021, this summer of freedom, inspire us to fully restore freedom of movement and to get Schengen ready for the future so our children can also work, study and travel all over Europe, when they like and wherever they like. And, to complete the Schengen Area, it’s time for Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia to take their place. ",

More than anything, the fact that we have to discuss this shows the need for education. I think there’s an incredible irony in the fact that these homophobic actions were sparked by the proposal to have an all-inclusive LGBTI sex education in Warsaw schools, precisely demonstrating why such comprehensive sex education is needed in the first place to combat ignorance and intolerance. I’ve heard people in here saying that ‘Polish people know better about Poland’, ‘Spanish people know better about Spain’.

I think that is most welcome and we knew that it had been in the pipeline for quite some time. However, this House has been debating the problems with golden passport since 2014. Why did it take so long? Why did the authorities wait so long to intervene? Why did we have to wait for brave journalists to uncover the scandals that we all suspected for a long time? And some of these journalists have paid a very high price – the highest price, as we know. But journalists are not responsible for law enforcement. The authorities are, and the authorities are failing. Those who have a legitimate interest in investing in the European economy can do so without problem, and no golden passport nor golden visa scheme can ever really be clean and legitimate – because due diligence that relies on cooperation with the Russian and the Chinese and the Saudi authorities, frankly, can never be watertight – and I’m being polite here. Despite the fancy names of the schemes – you know ‘residency by investment’ sounds nice, evokes these images of villas and yachts, and what have you – in reality, they are just a golden backdoor into the European Union for criminals, criminals. It’s not investment; it is criminal money. Now, we need a full ban, and we’re calling on the European Commission, not for the first time, to propose legislation, and I’m proud to say that at the initiative of my group Renew Europe, the Committee for Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) Committee is going to draft a legislative initiative calling for a ban on golden passports. But of course this is a national competence. You know, national governments cannot sell what is not theirs to sell, and that is EU citizenship. It isn’t theirs, they cannot sell it. So are governments, is the Council finally also going to take responsibility, or will they continue to knowingly facilitate criminals? The final question, Commissioner: will you also address the ‘legacy’ of those who have already received a Cypriot or Maltese or other passport? Will there be a second screening to see what kind of people we have actually elevated to the status of EU citizen?",

Let us think about the promotion of mental health, which still does not receive the importance it deserves, especially in such a historical period that has contributed to increasing fear, loneliness and uncertainty among the youngest citizens. The post-pandemic social recovery will not be easy - we all acknowledge that - but we cannot miss the opportunity of empowering our youth and supporting their social rights.

        "speech": " Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I am very pleased to see the ongoing commitment of this House to the safety and health of workers in the European Union. I fully share your engagement for safe and fair working conditions for all workers. I particularly want to thank the rapporteur, Madam Vind, and all those who have worked on this excellent report for this commitment.  First of all, I agree with you that prevention is key and that nobody should suffer from work-related diseases or accidents. This is why this strategic framework on health and safety at work 2021-2027 adopted last year puts forward the vision-zero approach under which various actions are being put in place, including awareness-raising and capacity-building. First, your report refers to Principle 10 of the Pillar of Social Rights that clearly states that workers have the right to a high level of protection of health and safety at work. This should apply to all workers, but I must say this should also apply to those who are self-employed. They deserve the same protection. Together, we have delivered the first commitment of the European cancer plan by adopting the fourth amendment of carcinogens, and with the gene’s directive, to protect workers from cancer.  I must say that I particularly appreciated also, the provision that improves the protection of those who work in the health sector; the majority, by the way, are women. They are exposed to dangerous substances. They have to handle the treatment of patients and many patients suffering from cancer. So here we have set an important standard, which now has to be implemented in the health sector. But we don’t stop here. Preparatory work on future batches of hazardous substances is ongoing. For instance, before the end of this year, the Commission aims to adopt the next proposal, revising the exposure limit values for lead, major reprotoxicants and di- isocyanates as well as to put forward its plans for revising a further 25 substances.  The Parliament has been particularly sensitive to the need to reduce workers exposure to asbestos. The rapporteur mentioned it; we had the debate not so long ago on the dangers of asbestos. I fully share this determination. As I have already informed your Parliament, the Commission will present a communication setting out measures under existing and new instruments in view of addressing the risks from asbestos. Your report mentions the terrible figures. Asbestos claims around 88 000 lives annually in the European Union and is responsible for 45% of all lung cancers. This is not a fatality. We have the possibility to reduce rapidly, and massively, these casualties. Therefore, we will also present a legislative proposal to lower the existing occupational exposure limit under the Asbestos at Work Directive. I agree with you that further action is also needed to protect workers from psychosocial risks. We strongly believe that the measures in this field must include tailor-made tools adjusted to specific national, local, socio-economic and cultural context. We are working on further actions in this area. For example, EU-OSHA 2023-3025 healthy workplaces campaign: safe and healthy work in the digital age, will, among others, address psychosocial and ergonomic risks. I know that your Parliament is very sensitive also to the issue of mental health, and this is a real issue. We have seen it during the pandemic, but mental health has affected a lot of young people, but more and more, it affects also many workers, more and more workers to burnouts, to stress, and I have read in your report that 51% of workers say that stress is common in their workplace. So we have really to develop practices, approaches to limit this impact on mental health through the working conditions. We are also ensuring a proper follow-up of the Parliament’s resolution on telework and the right to disconnect, in line with the Commission’s commitment to respond to resolutions from the European Parliament based on Article 225. The role of social partners is key in the realm, therefore, the Commission stands ready to support social partners in finding commonly agreed solutions to address these challenges and encourages social partners to follow up on their 2020 framework agreement on digitalisation. At the same time, the Commission is putting forward a number of actions to gather evidence and data on telework and the right to disconnect.  By the way, next week, together with the Parliament, we are organising a conference on the right to disconnect. This includes also a study analysing the trends and regulatory and policy landscape of telework and the right to disconnect in Europe, in the context of digitalisation and the future of work.  As we move forward, we are drawing lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic and looking at ways to increase preparedness for future crises. The commission continues working on an in-depth assessment on the effects of the pandemic and the efficiency of our frameworks to develop emergency procedures and guidance in any potential future health crisis. Particular attention will also be paid to health workers who put their lives on the line for us. Effective application and enforcement for the existing EU-OSHA legislation is paramount to properly protect workers in the EU and, at the same time, it contributes to the promotion of a level playing field in the Union. While the enforcement is mainly a national competence, the Senior Labour Inspectors’ Committee promotes effective and proper application of the EU legislation across Member States. I have to say that labour inspection is key and has to benefit from sufficient resources. I agree that the ILO recommendation of one labour inspector per 10 000 workers should be respected everywhere. We also need strong social dialogue to guarantee that enforcement. Our strategic framework has a global ambition. The EU promotes decent work across all sectors and policies in third countries and in global supply chains. On 23 February, the Commission adopted a communication on decent work worldwide. In the first half of 2023, the Commission, together with the Swedish Presidency, will organise a high level Occupational Safety and Health Summit, gathering the EU institutions, Member States, social partners, the EU-OSHA, and other relevant stakeholders. Your report represents an important contribution to the preparations of this summit. I know that Parliament gives its continued support and commitment to deliver on a healthy, safe and well-adapted work environment in Europe, and this Commission shares this commitment and will continue to work with you on its implementation.

The unfolding situation in Iran invites us to reflect on this puzzle. Once again, Ukraine finds itself the tragic recipient of collateral damage that was hardly foreseeable, but how enthusiastically should we side with the citizens of Iran challenging their regime and its military and holding them responsible for targeting a passenger plane? For sure, human error might seem like a partial excuse, but equally, human error could, and should, have been foreseen and precautions taken. On the other hand, some actions are neither accidental nor excusable, and where aggression precedes self-defence we should not hesitate to apportion blame, especially if the perpetrator was once our ally. The obligation for de-escalating a crisis must fall to the aggressor and not just to those tempted to retaliate.",

But the vision contains a central weakness: there is no binding requirement for Member States to integrate the objectives of the vision into their CAP strategic plans. Now, CAP, of course, is fundamentally flawed in the first place. It’s a very unequal distribution system and it’s biased in favour of big agri and intensive farms and feedlots at the expense of small farms and family farms. Europe has lost a third of its family farms between 2003 and 2013. It’s a frightening statistic. To help rural areas, we must stop industrial farm expansion by rebalancing the value chain for the benefit of farmers and by banning below—cost selling of food. Building a new vision for rural areas should start with a radical change in agricultural and trade policy, and that should start with the abandoning of the Mercosur agreement.",

        "speech": " Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, we have just heard from Josep Borrell about the basic parameters and the information on what we call the ‘infodemic’ that is going on in parallel with the pandemic we are going through. This is why we decided to prepare the communication and adopt the communication, which has the title ‘Getting the Facts Right’. It was necessary because we needed to inform about what have been the steps taken up to now against disinformation because, in the COVID—19 context we didn’t start from scratch fighting against disinformation. We already had the Code of Practice and we had the Action Plan, and its second purpose was to come up with a to—do list for all involved, especially the platforms, to step up their work. In the communication we comprehensively address three things: the sources of disinformation, its channels and amplifiers, and also the targets. Josep talked about the foreign sources of disinformation and I am glad about this because I believe that a geopolitical EU can only materialise if we are assertive, but we also have to put our own house in order. We need to beef up our strategy on communication. We have to get our story out about Europe and EU support during the coronavirus crisis, and it is high time we step up on this and do not allow others to occupy that space. Now to the channels of communication and disinformation – especially the online platforms. I welcome the measures taken by them in this crisis; their strong commitment is heavily needed. I believe that the fact that we worked with the platforms, and we designed with them the code of practice on disinformation, helped to roll out new policies more quickly. We agreed with the platforms that they would promote links to the World Health Organization and health authorities and remove ads that offered fake medicines or inflate prices for normal products or give very dangerous advice, which we already heard from Joseph. These actions brought results. For example, Google blocked or removed globally over 80 million coronavirus—related ads. But there is room for improvement and our code was just a first step. We need to ensure transparency and accountability. Citizens need to know how information is reaching them and where it comes from. Our joint communication calls on the platforms to step up their efforts and to report monthly on their policies and actions to address COVID—19—related disinformation – not to report to the Commission, to report to the public, so that people can read about what’s happening online. The targets – well, it’s about us, it’s about the citizens of Europe. Lying is neither new nor that scary in itself. What scares me is that we believe in those lies too easily. This is why we need to become more resilient and critical as a society. We need to support free and independent media – the fact—checkers and researchers. And we have to step up our education. We will have the Digital Education Action Plan soon, adopted by the Commission, and there will be a very strong chapter on how to become more resilient and increase our critical thinking through education.  We will support fact-checking and research activities through the recently established European Digital Media Observatory. In this context, later this month, we will launch a EUR 9 million call for research hubs in the different Member States.  Also, we have to speak in this context about the freedom of speech, which remains our basic principle. Laws which define criminal penalties for spreading disinformation in too broad terms, and with disproportionate sanctions, can damage accountability mechanisms, which are just as important as ever. It can make the work of journalists more difficult, cause self—censorship and damage freedom of expression. This is not the European way. It is bad for democracies and it is self—defeating. Our best defence against disinformation are free and plural media, informed and active citizens and resilient democratic institutions in which they can trust.  I really want to insist on this because I believe this is a distinctive part of our policies. I do not want to create any Ministry of Truth. I used to live in a system, before 1989, with only one official truth, no pluralism of media, opinion, or even thought.  A competitive market of ideas enabled by free speech is essential in democracies. Just as in traditional competition policy where consumers benefit from fair competition and a level playing field, citizens benefit from fair competition of free speech. To conclude, the communication is the first building block of this new Commission in response to disinformation. We are working on the Digital Services Act and the European Democracy Action Plan where we will address illegal content and harmful content like disinformation.  In this context, I really appreciate that we can work on this together with the committee which you established in Parliament, because I believe that common work can bring good fruit. ",

        "speech": "Rapporteur. – Madam President, Commissioner, I’m happy to introduce the report on employment and social policies in the euro area, which was widely supported in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. Coming from Estonia, I can be proud that, during our Presidency of the Council of the European Union, our Prime Minister, Jüri Ratas, had the privilege of co-signing, with Jean—Claude Juncker, the European Pillar of Social Rights. That was on 17 November 2017. This ambitious document, supported by the European Parliament, sets out important principles that we will have to implement now in the Member States. I have to thank Commissioner Thyssen for her hard work on improving social policies across the Union. We all know that this is not easy: every time, when it comes to social standards across the Union, somebody says ‘No, no no’, and refers to the principle of subsidiarity. At the same time, we all know that the situation is far from ideal. Since 2012, in the context of the European semester, the Commission has been issuing country-specific recommendations, not only on economics but also with regard to social policies in the euro area. This is an extremely important process but unfortunately – and this is reflected in the report – the rate of implementation of these recommendations is unacceptably low. Whereas at least some progress, or what was termed progress, was reported concerning 72% of country-specific recommendations in 2012, the figure decreased to 39%, the lowest rate ever, in 2018. So we are asking the Commission to take measures and find a way to convince Member States that the social health of the European Union is not less important than defence, the single market, or whatever other common policy of the Union. We are also asking them to consider extending these recommendations to non-euro states. I was happy to hear the new head of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, during her speech here before she was approved by Parliament, promising that, during the first 100 days of her term of office, she will come up with new legislative mechanisms to ensure for Europeans a fair minimum wage. For those who are sceptical, I have to underline that this proposal will take into account national traditions and legislation, which means that nobody is going to violate the principle of subsidiarity. The thing is that we have to fight so-called ‘working poverty’, and help people who live at the risk of poverty and social exclusion, otherwise we will end up in Europe with brain drain and depopulated areas, on the one hand, and more protests and Polish plumbers, on the other. During their hearings, several Commissioners-designate referred to a bill of social rights as a universal tool to solve the problems of depopulated regions and rural areas, but we also have people with disabilities, we have a gender pay gap, we have minorities facing discrimination and people at risk of poverty, and we have to help them. This is exactly what Europeans want, not only from national governments but also from us, the elected representatives in the European Union. In the report there is also a call for the Commission to create a new unemployment insurance scheme, which was warmly welcomed by trade unions. A funny thing that happened yesterday evening was that I received a letter from the European Confederation of Trade Unions in which they asked me to support my own report. When I answered them that this was kind of funny, they told me ‘No, no, you have to support this and that amendments.’  I really believe we’re standing for the right thing here, and, colleagues, I rely on your support.",

        "speech": " Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, we jointly created the RRF to face the economic and social impacts of the pandemic. Today we face a new crisis provoked by Russia. Inflation has reached a record high, hitting both consumers and businesses across Europe. And we see a major increase in prices, especially in energy and raw materials. So we have to monitor closely the impact of these developments on RRF implementation. But let me say very clearly that the situation confirms the importance and the timeliness of the Facility. The RRF ensures that the Union acts as one in such difficult times, creating effective and aligned measures to boost investments and reforms across all Member States. And this is especially important with the low level of growth that we have in these months. Of course, it is not easy to deliver under such a short time frame. As your report highlights, the Commission must and will closely monitor Member States’ progress in implementing the plans. And we will only disburse funds when Member States fulfil the milestones and targets they have committed to. Overall, the RRF is supporting the green transition by allocating almost 40% of national plans to the climate and financing only measures that do no significant harm to the environment. Digitalisation is also crucial, with over well over 20% of the funds. The plans also contribute to social objectives and the implementation of the pillar of social rights. Around 30% of funds contribute to social expenditure for education, labour market, health and skills. So a swift implementation of measures across the six pillars of the regulation is key, and Member States are acting on all six pillars. When looking back at the progress made so far, we have almost EUR 100 billion in RRF funds disbursed and EUR 114 billion issued in just one year. We can proudly say that implementation is well on track and I am happy that your implementation report expresses the same view. It acknowledges the work done by Member States and the EU institutions to bring the RRF to life, and I am glad that the Parliament has found our Recovery and Resilience Scoreboard and the first RRF annual report useful. We take note of the Parliament’s call for better communication in the Member States. We will take up this call with our interlocutors in the Member States and discuss how each can be more transparent and proactive in communicating the implementation and the content of their plans with the stakeholders. I would like to reaffirm that we will make no compromise when it comes to the protection of the Union’s financial interests. This is why we must also protect the Union’s budget against breaches of the rule of law. As you know, a few weeks ago we published our assessment of the Polish plan. The Commission has worked closely with the Polish authorities for more than one year since the submission of the plan and scrutinised each measure. Poland has committed to strengthen important aspects of the independence of the judiciary. To leave no ambiguity on the matter, when the Council adopts a plan the real work begins. Poland needs to deliver on its commitments on the rule of law before any payment can be made. The positive assessment and adoption of the plan does not lead in itself to any disbursement. We will also continue to address rule of law issues through other instruments specifically designed for this purpose. Let me end now with a glimpse to REPowerEU. You have seen the proposal for which we want to use the power and the available loan capacity of the RRF, as well as additional funds, to swiftly and effectively strengthen Europe’s open strategic autonomy, wean ourselves off Russian fossil fuels, support renewables, and reduce energy consumption overall. So I look forward to hearing your views also on REPowerEU during this debate, and to work with you in the coming months to bring this important proposal to life.",

We take home the invitation to bring even more reasons to continue the dialogue, to engage strategically and mobilise resources for the benefit of citizens on both sides of this other transatlantic relationship.  One thing is clear: the green and digital transitions will be just and sustainable only if enough countries around the globe join us in this endeavour. And Latin America and the Caribbean region is a natural partner to make this happen.  There is a common understanding that we need to advance on the conclusion and ratification of pending agreements. These will open up new areas of cooperation and opportunities for both regions.  In the particular case of Mercosur, as mentioned today, the change of dynamics brought by the new Brazilian administration brings a window of opportunity that cannot be lost. We need to intensify our bi-regional political dialogue at all levels and the work of the EuroLat Parliamentary Assembly remains key along the way. It is remarkable that the Euro-Latin American Assembly has never ceased its work since its creation 16 years ago, helping to build bridges, even in the absence of summits.  Indeed, we have a lot of work ahead of us to put relations between all regions in the place they deserve. Let me thank this Parliament for its continued support to achieve this objective. We have a lot of things to do in 2023, but maybe starting from tomorrow. ",

We believe that further restriction of those substances will help close the ozone layer and as such will contribute to the public health. So I believe we will be able to support this proposal successfully tomorrow.  Now, concerning the second regulation on fluorinated gases, we have here, as correctly said, ambitious proposals from the Environmental Committee aiming to vastly and fastly reduce the use of fluorinated gases. The direction is good, to my feeling with this report, we would undermine further sustainability elements such as the circular economy, energy or material efficiency. And as well, we could put a risk on meeting the goals of the REPowerEU.  This is the reason why some elements have been some amendments, parallel plenary amendments have been tabled in order to address those concerns. I believe that we will be able also to support those amendments.  One example for all Renew Europe proposes to bring into the game the spare parts, because we definitely do not want to force the public to buy new devices before the end of the given life of their currently used product.

In Iran, the death penalty is used as a political tool that not only punishes those who have been sentenced to capital punishment, but also those who advocate for its abolition. It’s the case of Narges Mohammadi, who has recently been sentenced to another eight years in prison, or Nasrin Sotoudeh, the recipient of the Sakharov Prize in 2012, who was sentenced to 33 years and six months in prison in 2019. I would like also to stress that we continue to ask for the freedom of Djalali, as this Parliament already recalled in the past. Today, we call again on Iran to fulfil its international obligations by abolishing the death penalty and implementing its human rights commitments. We also urge the immediate release for all unjustly jailed human rights defenders. As we speak, crucial negotiations are undergoing in Vienna to revive the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Even if the scope of these talks do not include a dialogue on the situation of human rights in Iran, the two are deeply interlinked. A successful negotiation of the JCPOA will provide the basis for the peace and development needed for a more stable country that over time improves the prospects for all Iranian citizens who, we shouldn’t forget, have been the most affected by COVID and the economic sanctions. We need more dialogue with Iran, not less. The EU and other actors have already adopted a number of sanctions against individuals and entities responsible for human rights violations in Iran. Exercising further pressure has to go hand in hand with general political engagement, as some groups in this Parliament are advocating for. And this will, in a certain moment, help us as well to improve the situation of human rights in the country. The EU should continue to monitor and raise human rights matters in the context of the EU—Iran high—level dialogue and reiterate that respect for human rights is a core component in advancement of EU—Iran relations. It is in our interest to support the talks, to return to the JCPOA, also to have more leverage to improve the human rights situation in the country.",

        "speech": "rapporteur. – Madam President, this is a historic moment. The European Climate Law is indeed the cornerstone of the European Green Deal, as it enshrines into legislation the Union’s objective to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 at the latest. The climate neutrality objective brings with it a transition of historic dimension, which Europe will undergo in the coming decades. We are moving away from our history as the coal and steel union and heading towards climate neutrality. The report that we will see voted on this afternoon improves the Commission’s proposal on a number of points and, colleagues, we are responsible for this; we need to listen to citizens, scientists and the movement of young people and do our very best to improve this legislation and make it responsible for our time. The report sets a binding target for the Union and the Member States to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest. Thereafter, emissions shall be negative. Everyone must contribute to reach the climate neutrality objective. This is something we need to do together. The report proposes a strengthened 2030 climate target of 60% in order to be in line with science and give Europe the best possible chance of reaching its climate neutrality objective and respecting the Paris Agreement. We need to have a higher target for 2030. The Commission has proposed a net target of at least 55% for 2030, meaning approximately between 51% and 53% in real emission reductions, depending on how much greenhouse gas our natural sinks will be able to remove from the atmosphere. This is not good enough. We need a stronger target if we are serious about respecting the Paris Agreement and our own responsibility to reach climate neutrality. This is also why the report includes a new EU climate target for 2040. This is a crucial element to ensure that Europe is on track to achieve climate neutrality by 2050.  To take responsible climate action, we also need to know exactly how much Europe can emit without undermining the Union’s commitment under the Paris Agreement. Therefore, the report also calls for the introduction of a greenhouse gas budget setting out the total remaining quantity of greenhouse gas emissions as CO2 equivalent that could be emitted up to 2050 without putting at risk the 1.5 degree temperature goal. Elements of social fairness and solidarity have been strengthened throughout the regulation. For the S&D Group, this is fundamental. We will only succeed in our climate efforts if everyone is with us, if no one is left behind. It must be socially just and we must make sure that it’s for all the citizens.  I would like to underline the importance of the reference to the 2015 International Labour Organization’s guidelines for a just transition towards environmentally sustainable economies and societies. We also emphasise the importance of social partners, which I’m very proud of. There are also strong provisions on science, not to mention the set-up of an independent climate council at European level: the European Climate Change Council (ECCC), which, with the creation of climate advisory bodies at Member State level, will assess whether we are on track to achieve the climate neutrality objective and identify opportunities to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the carbon sequestration potential. Furthermore, the provisions for climate adaptation have been strengthened, with increased consideration of vulnerable groups.  I will conclude by saying this is a good proposal. I would like to thank my colleagues, all the shadows, all the people that worked with this legislation, the advisors, and also the interpretation, which has been good, the technical advisers. Thank you so much. No one is left behind. (Applause)",

        "speech": " membre de la Commission. – Monsieur le Président, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, pour commencer, je voudrais réitérer ce que la présidente de la Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, a affirmé avec force le mois dernier dans son discours sur l’état de l’Union devant ce Parlement: les valeurs européennes ne sont pas à vendre. Malheureusement, cette déclaration ne semble pas aussi évidente qu’elle devrait l’être partout dans l’Union. Certains États membres ont, en effet, mis en place des systèmes permettant à de riches investisseurs et aux membres de leur famille d’obtenir un passeport en échange du paiement d’une somme d’argent importante ou d’un investissement conséquent, sans avoir un lien réel avec l’État membre en question. De tels programmes ont des implications évidentes pour tous les autres États membres et pour l’Union dans son ensemble. En effet, le fait de devenir ressortissant d’un État membre entraîne automatiquement l’obtention de la citoyenneté de l’Union ainsi que tous les droits qui y sont liés. Un investisseur étranger qui achète la nationalité d’un État membre de l’Union peut, sur cette base, se rendre immédiatement dans n’importe quel autre État membre, y exercer une activité économique et bénéficier du principe de non-discrimination entre citoyens européens dans une série de domaines. Il peut même participer au processus démocratique, notamment par l’exercice de son droit de vote et de celui d’être candidat aux élections européennes ou municipales. For several years now, these programmes have been a source of great concern, notably for this House and the Commission. The Commission has worked hard on this matter, as it is also a European issue with European values at stake. In January 2019, the Commission published its first-ever report on investor citizenship schemes and investor residence schemes operated in the EU. The report clearly spelled out the inherent risks of such schemes, in particular as regards security, money laundering, tax evasion and corruption. Since the beginning of this Commission’s mandate, we have continuously raised this concern with the Member States concerned, urging them to reconsider their decision to operate such schemes.  Since the beginning of my mandate, I have had a constant dialogue with the relevant Member States where I repeatedly highlighted the Commission’s concerns and urged them to reconsider their decision to operate such schemes. Before the pandemic, I met personally with the Ministers of the relevant Member States to discuss investor citizenship schemes. In April, I followed up with letters asking to reconsider the schemes. I also had several calls with the competent Ministers to follow up on their commitments to provide more information on their government’s plan. While both Malta and Cyprus may have the intention to apply some changes to their investor citizenship schemes, they appear to be determined to continue their schemes in some form. We need to convince them not to do that. Mesdames et messieurs les députés, une série de récents scandales à Chypre et à Malte ne font que confirmer les graves préoccupations que nous avions déjà exprimées. Dans son rapport, la Commission s’était engagée à surveiller la conformité des régimes en place avec le droit de l’Union et, le cas échéant, à prendre les mesures nécessaires. Aujourd’hui, je suis ici pour vous dire que la Commission tient cet engagement. La Commission a décidé cette semaine d’ouvrir des procédures d’infraction à l’encontre des programmes de citoyenneté par investissement mis en place par Chypre et Malte. EU citizenship is a collection of shared rights that all Member States provide in solidarity. Together, the Member States create the conditions for the enjoyment of EU citizenship. The European Court of Justice has been clear: it is for each Member State to lay down the conditions for the acquisition and loss of nationality. But, as the Court has also ruled, this competence must be exercised having due regard for EU law.  EU law requires Member States to recognise the nationality of another Member State without imposing any other conditions. As a result, the decision to naturalise a person by a Member State is not limited to its own jurisdiction and is not neutral with regard to other Member States. Member States should, therefore, use their prerogatives to grant nationality with due regard for EU law and, in particular, to the principle of sincere cooperation which is laid down in the Treaties. A Member State fails in that obligation when it establishes a scheme which systematically grants naturalisation in the absence of any true link with the state and on the sole basis of a financial investment or, in other words, where passports are for sale.  Over the span of only a couple of years, Cyprus and Malta have naturalised several thousand persons based on their schemes. The price for a European passport in those Member States range between EUR 1 million and EUR 2 million. These investor citizenship schemes undermine the mutual trust of Member States in each other’s naturalisation procedures. This trust is a precondition for the effective enjoyment of EU citizenship rights. By undermining this trust, these schemes threaten the integrity of EU citizenship and its proper functioning and violate the principle of sincere cooperation. Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, Malte semble s’être engagée à remplacer le régime actuel par un nouveau programme, sur des bases a priori largement inchangées. À Chypre, alors que le gouvernement a annoncé la fin du régime actuel dans un avenir proche, la mise en place d’un nouveau programme est déjà évoquée. Mais la question est trop importante pour attendre l’aboutissement de ce processus. Nous prenons maintenant des mesures pour montrer notre détermination et notre engagement à ne pas accepter que la citoyenneté de l’Union soit mise sur le marché comme une simple commodité. Je pense que nous pouvons tous nous accorder sur un point important: les principes et les valeurs de l’Union sont affaiblis si l’appartenance au projet européen, les droits qui en découlent et la participation à sa vie démocratique font l’objet d’une simple transaction économique. Let me also add a couple of words on Bulgaria, which also operates an investor citizenship scheme. This week, the Commission sent a letter to the Bulgarian authorities strongly urging them to phase out their scheme in the context of an ongoing national legislative procedure to change the Bulgarian citizenship law. We have also asked for additional information on the scheme. The Commission will not hesitate to consider an infringement procedure against Bulgaria if necessary. Finally, the Commission has not forgotten about schemes that give foreign investors access to residence permits, also called ‘golden visas’. While golden visa schemes do not raise the same legal issues as schemes that result in the acquisition of EU citizenship, there is often a close interaction between the two types of scheme, as residence can be a prerequisite for the acquisition of nationality. Most of the inherent risks of such schemes, for example regarding security, money laundering and corruption, are the same. Third-country nationals with a valid EU residence permit can travel freely, in particular in the Schengen area. This means that if one Member State does not apply the necessary security checks, other Member States can be negatively affected. Member States should therefore ensure that all the necessary steps are taken to prevent security, corruption, tax evasion and money laundering risks. They must also apply rigorous and transparent criteria to identify and combat crime and corruption.  The Commission has expressed its concern about the risks inherent in residence schemes and about the fact that these risks are not always sufficiently mitigated by the measures taken by Member States. In this context, the Commission continues to closely monitor these schemes and their application, to ensure compliance with EU law, including the need to carry out all obligatory border and security checks, in line with the EU acquis prior to the issuance of any permit.  Il en va de même pour les régimes de citoyenneté gérés par des pays tiers, y compris quelques pays candidats à l’adhésion, qui bénéficient d’un accès sans visa à l’Union. Un tel accès ne devrait pas être utilisé comme un outil de marketing pour attirer de l’argent en échange de la citoyenneté. À la suite de l’adoption de son rapport de janvier 2019, la Commission a demandé des informations et a fait part de ses préoccupations à tous les pays tiers exemptés de l’obligation de visa qui appliquent ou planifient des programmes de citoyenneté par investissement et ce, en étroite coopération avec le Service européen pour l’action extérieure. En conséquence, certains pays ont déjà abrogé leur régime et d’autres ont mis fin à leur projet. Nous allons continuer de suivre la question de près afin d’évaluer tout risque éventuel en matière de sécurité lié à ces régimes. Je me réjouis en tout cas d’avoir pu expliquer la politique menée par la Commission, ce matin, devant votre Parlement et je serais très heureux de prendre connaissance, bien entendu, de vos observations et de répondre à vos questions.",

Since then, the EU has reacted poorly to the bullying by the Americans, who seem determined to show that the EU is just a puppet of theirs.  The Americans didn’t just withdraw: they pressured other members of the JCPOA not to comply with their commitments. So, incredibly, we had a situation where the US were threatening to punish other members of the UN if they complied with a UN Security Council resolution. Biden campaigned during the election on renewing the JCPOA. He could have issued an executive order as soon as he got elected, but he didn’t. Was he pressured by the Israelis? If the Israelis are so worried about Iran’s nuclear programme, why don’t they offer to give up their nuclear weapons in return for Iran not having a nuclear programme? We need the EU now to work for the original JCPOA, not a restricted American version of it, and the EU should also work for a completely nuclear-free zone in West Asia. ",

        "speech": " Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank, also on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Urpilainen, the Rapporteur, and the Committee on Development, for putting forward this very useful report on the European financial architecture for development.  I agree with many of the considerations outlined in this report and its conclusions. European financial architecture for development is an important building block of our more effective and more impactful cooperation with partner countries. We are confronted today with multiple crises – the consequences of COVID-19, the Russian aggression against Ukraine, debt pressure, food insecurity, energy costs and climate change. All of these exacerbate the gap in finances needed to achieve the sustainable development goals.  To make the best possible use of scarce resources and to achieve sustainable impact, we need a joint European response combining all relevant instruments and actors. Following a system-wide review of the European financial architecture for development already in 2019, the Commission adopted its timely roadmap for an improved effort last March. The roadmap is organised around four different areas. First, providing a strong policy steer to strengthen alignment with EU policy objectives. Two, enhancing coordination and providing incentives to work together. Three, making the architecture more inclusive, and four, raising the visibility of EU actions.  Since then, significant progress has been made in all these four areas. Let me briefly mention some examples.  On strategic steering, all investment operations financed from the EU budget are scrutinised to ensure that they comply with programming documents, that they align with team Europe initiatives and the EU’s global policy priorities, such as delivering on the global gateway strategy and the Green Deal, and also mainstreaming gender and environmental aspects.  We aim to make use of our various EU tools and development actors in smart and flexible ways. For instance, the European Investment Bank will benefit from the dedicated guarantee windows, but will also be able to use the private sector guarantees under EFSD+ open architecture. The Commission is currently assessing the outcome of the call for proposals.  I share your views on the importance of inclusiveness. In principle, all EU pillar assessed financial institutions are eligible to use the open architecture guarantee. This includes multilateral institutions and regional development banks, while also relying, whenever possible, on European financial institutions.  Under the EFSD+ open architecture, we received guarantee proposals from 20 potential implementing partners – exceeding expectations. Several new partners submitted proposals for the first time from within the EU and outside. For instance, the Caribbean Development Bank. We will be able to select those proposals which offer a strong development impact and best fit our strategic policy priorities. I fully agree that efforts should improve the EU’s visibility and impact of its development finance. Many EU delegations report that the Team Europe Initiative’s design process has significantly increased cooperation with European development finance institutions on the ground.  You also call for effective governance of the global gateway strategy. The Commission and Member States agreed to set up a global gateway board to provide strategic steering, and we propose that the European Parliament is of course involved as observer, and a dedicated business advisory group to exchange with European businesses. This will allow strong strategic guidance on our collective ambitions. ",

        "speech": " – Thank you, Mr President, and thank you, Commissioner. We live in a divided world today. And a dangerous world. More than in a very long time, with increasing global hunger, with 100 million refugees, with war in Europe. All these crises have different causes, but our fossil-fuel dependence is definitely adding more wood to the fire. The now-expanding EU ETS is Europe’s flagship programme and perhaps the world’s sharpest climate tool to reduce emissions. There will be many beautiful speeches here today, more of them and all about how we are so responsible to tackle the climate change. I urge you to look past that and look instead to the vote tomorrow. Look closely at it, because it will be the European masters on how we vote in Europe for climate. Will the nice words in support the climate actually be worth anything when serious and concrete measures are on the table? That is what this is about. We have clear alternatives on our table. Either we go faster than the Commission when reducing our emissions, just as we did in the ENVI meeting of two weeks ago. Or we delay, we delay the reduction of the cap into a more distant future. Either we support a generous compromise to phase out free allowances to ’30-32, or we go slower than the Commission’s proposal. Either we support the ETS 2 – for buildings, transport, with massive social safeguards to save the Social Climate Fund – or we throw both climate and energy poverty measures into the bin. As this S&D shadow, I have three priorities: raise the ambition for climate, improve fairness to industry and the secure the social inclusion. The ENVI outcome secured climate ambition by going faster in expanding ETS to maritime, covering more emissions, more ships, eventually also removing the 50% rebate for the international shipping. We improved fairness to industry by providing both sticks and carrots, by example by the stronger Climate Investment Fund and – with our price cap, social climate fund preparation period for households entering into 2029, the energy price, emergency brake and the requirement for oil companies to pay their fair share –we safeguard the social dimension on the ETS 2. The citizens are watching us tomorrow. It is our Parliament’s chance to deliver to climate, to deliver to the socially fair future, and to make sure that we are really proving that the speeches are more than that. It’s reality and we are doing it together.  (The speaker agreed to respond to a blue-card speech)",

        "speech": " Member of the Commission. – Mr President, Schengen is the largest free travel area in the world, an area of freedom, security and justice, bringing liberty, prosperity, and identity because Schengen is part of who we are. So I say to the people of Croatia ‘welcome’, my warmest congratulations. You will start a new year as members of the euro and members of Schengen. But when it comes to the decision on Bulgaria and Romania, I need to express my deep disappointment. I deeply regret the Council did not take a positive decision. Especially, since it has long been the Commission’s view that Bulgaria and Romania fulfil all the criteria to be full members of the Schengen area, for more than 11 years already. And as two recent voluntary fact—finding missions have confirmed, Bulgaria and Romania are upholding Schengen standards of border protection and security, and are doing so efficiently, reliably, honourably. All these years, Bulgaria and Romania helped build a well—functioning Schengen area, dealing effectively with the pandemic and with the fallout of Putin’s war. Romania and Bulgaria are doing an incredible job in managing the consequences of the war in Ukraine. Bulgaria provides temporary protection to around 150 000 Ukrainian refugees. 2.5 million people from Ukraine entered into Romania this year so far, receiving support and assistance. I saw for myself at the Siret border crossing the endless lines of women and children, tired and afraid, and the border guards making sure they could cross swiftly and orderly and in a secure way. Bulgaria and Romania have highly trained and dedicated staff, state of the art infrastructure, and know-how. They have done the work. They are ready. They deserve to be in. More than that, it is a legal obligation and they have a legitimate expectation to join. These are the rules. And Schengen too is ready. This is not the Schengen of 2011, but a stronger Schengen. With new Schengen governance around dedicated Schengen councils, with a key role for the European Parliament. Welcoming Bulgaria and Romania will remain my main priority. I’m determined to make this happen. This is important for the citizens of Romania and Bulgaria. We will continue to work hard together with the Council to welcome Bulgaria and Romania next year. And I know that I can count on the continued support of the European Parliament. We need Bulgaria and Romania in Schengen, like we need Croatia and all its other members. I am the first to say, there are challenges in the European Union, but we must not confuse them with the Schengen enlargement criteria. Challenges related to migration, to security, to the rule of law exist. Yes, they do. And we are addressing them with European solutions on all fronts. Fighting organised crime – one of my top priorities – we gave Europol a stronger mandate, we are boosting police cooperation. We fight corruption and uphold the rule of law with our strong rule of law mechanism. We respond to migration challenges with very operational plans. Just last week, we presented a new action plan on the Western Balkans. And one very positive result of last week’s Council, thanks to the leadership of the Czech presidency, is the clear progress on the pact on migration and asylum, with negotiations on important files that we hope to close this week here in Strasbourg. Delaying Bulgaria and Romania entering Schengen will not make it easier to address these shared challenges. Quite the contrary, welcoming Bulgaria and Romania will make us stronger, safer and protect all borders better. By moving border guards and resources from internal borders to protect the EU external border, connecting Bulgaria and Romania to Schengen security databases, stepping up police cooperation and information exchange, cross—border surveillance and hot pursuit. And regular comprehensive Schengen evaluations will make sure standards remain high. The truth is simple; to fight crime and corruption and manage migration together we need Bulgaria and Romania in. Their membership will also bring a much needed boost to the internal market by eliminating time lost at borders and by boosting travel, trade and tourism. So we all lost in the vote last week. There is only one winner, and he lives in the Kremlin. And I know December is the season of giving, but I should say no presents for Putin. Honourable Members, divided we are weak, united we are strong. As a Union, we must now welcome Bulgaria and Romania to Schengen as we promised, as they deserve, as it’s only right. If we don’t, then we are playing into Russia’s hands, allowing division, disunity and discord to spread. But if we do welcome them, then we all win. We will all benefit from greater security and prosperity. And we should show the world that at a time of our greatest need, Europe stands together.",

Dear Colleagues, as announced at the beginning of this part-session, our agenda of this week is dominated by the situation in Ukraine.  Today, we are starting our day with the most pressing debate on EU-Russia relations, European security and Russia’s military threat against Ukraine amidst intense international diplomatic exchanges to de-escalate the situation.  I am pleased to welcome the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell Fontelles, who are with us to discuss the latest developments on the ground in the wider context of European security and EU-Russia relations. Welcome to the plenary. On behalf of the European Parliament, we have repeatedly expressed solidarity with the people of Ukraine as they continue to face the uncertainty of the past weeks and fear of Russian military aggression. What we are witnessing here is also a threat to peace in Europe. I want to recall that, in September last year, the European Parliament adopted a resolution that called for containing Russia’s influence in the EU and its Eastern Neighbourhood and, in December last year, we also adopted a resolution where we criticised the actions of the Russian authorities and underlined our preparedness to ‘agree swiftly on further joint action’, including sanctions.  Today, just after this debate, we will vote on granting EUR 1.2 billion of ‘macro—financial assistance to Ukraine’. I would like to thank the European Commission for this timely proposal to support Ukraine’s financial stability and resilience in the current difficult circumstances.  Also later today, the Conference of Presidents will discuss the declaration on the situation in Ukraine. I would like to stress that, while we urge for a de-escalation of the current tension between Ukraine and Russia, this Parliament stands ready to support swift, forceful and concrete action, in coordination with other European institutions. The Union’s unity and close cooperation with our partners are key for the European Union to play a strong role on the international stage and to contribute to peace and security. We would be interested to know how lessons learned from the current situation will also be reflected in the works on the future Strategic Compass for the EU. Finally, I would like to thank you, President Michel, President von den Leyen and High Representative Borrell, for your engagement in the intense consultation on identifying ways to address the situation at the EU’s eastern borders and your efforts to uphold fundamental principles of the existing European security architecture.

On the national unity government, we are reaching out to the national unity government at an increasingly higher level. They are vital stakeholders in Myanmar’s future, and we welcome the decision of ASEAN’s own summit in November to officially engage with them as well. The EU is a significant humanitarian donor in Myanmar, but it is true the United Nations humanitarian appeal is very under—funded. We also continue to help the 1 million Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.  With regard to the summit and region to region relations, we agreed on substantial language on the Indo-Pacific and South China Sea, and we would be happy to cooperate more strongly with ASEAN within the UN, notably with Malaysia and Indonesia, which are currently members of the Human Rights Council.

They managed to receive a doubled budget for their activities with respect to the previous year.

I think this is testament to how far attitudes have moved in my own lifetime, indeed.  We stand here today in solidarity with those brave members of sexual minorities in Uganda and elsewhere who face not just public prejudice, but also the full force of the State aimed at repressing their very nature. The bravery of those activists is truly admirable. They stand up in the most hostile of circumstances to say ‘We are who we are. We are equal in dignity and rights and we should be free’.  The situation in Uganda is indeed very worrying. The killing of Brian Wasswa earlier this month was a horrific act and the perpetrator must be brought to justice. The deliberate stoking of anti-gay hatred by government ministers must be absolutely and strongly condemned. With this resolution we are calling on the Ugandan Government to fully respect the rights of LGBTQIA people, not just to stop the whole hate-filled rhetoric but to ensure that Ugandan law does not discriminate against anyone on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity. Today we say to everyone fighting for those rights in Uganda, and worldwide: we in Europe stand with you. ",

        "speech": "deputising for the author. – Madam President, we now turn to a very important discussion on climate change and the climate conference that we’re going to have in Glasgow in two weeks’ time, which is very clearly going to be one of the most important climate conferences we’ve seen in the last couple of years, where member states of the world need to be stepping up their climate ambition. If you look at climate science and the latest IPCC report that was launched in August this summer, it is becoming more and more clear that the climate impacts are more severe and there are clearer reasons to limit global warming well below two degrees, as we said in the Paris Agreement. We have now very clearly said that we want to keep it below 1.5 degrees.  If you look at the current pledges on the table, we are not on track. What’s even worse is that, at this stage, if we look at all the national pledges around the world, emissions are still expected to rise by 2030. However, the IPCC and climate science is making very clear that by 2030, in order to keep 1.5 degrees within reach, we need a reduction of 45% by 2030 globally. Yet we are not on track if we look at the current pledges.  This is also why the Glasgow moment is so important for raising the ambition of all the different countries in the world. We are very much aware – and this is also described in the resolution – of the achievements and the changes that we have seen in the United States. However, we are, of course, also concerned about the developments in the United States in translating their promises into legislation, and there we see some issues as well, which are sure to be debated in Glasgow. But we are also very concerned about the other big player: China. Their pledges to reach carbon neutrality by 2060 and the peak of emissions by 2030 are insufficient if we look at what needs to happen. We will make that message also very clear.  We also expect stronger commitments from some of our partner countries. A country like Australia is certainly worth mentioning, because they have not yet come forward with climate neutrality targets despite all the other developed countries doing so.  Looking at Europe – and this is clearly in the resolution – we comment on the ‘Fit for 55’ and the package that is there upfront. However, we do realise that steps need to be taken within Europe to translate that into law. The proposals have been made by the Commission, but we as a House, and also the Member States, need to develop on that. Very importantly – and this is probably also an assignment for the European Commission – there is still a lack of mainstreaming of the Green Deal and climate policies into all the areas and fields. I would certainly also like to mention climate finance here.  In this regard, maybe it would sometimes be good to refer to the Paris Agreement, because quite often people talk about the Paris Agreement, but you sometimes wonder whether people have really read the Paris Agreement. Article 2, the backbone of the Paris Agreement, makes very clear that things need to happen on mitigation and adaptation, but the third element of Article 2 very clearly also obliges all the signatories of the Paris Agreement to make their financial flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development. So the third pillar of the Paris Agreement, besides mitigation, adaptation, is making the financial flows consistent with our low carbon pathways. Here is another assignment for Europe where action is still to be taken.  Looking at all the issues that are on the table, at the rulebook, we are happy that Europe is finally taking steps on the common five years’ timeframe. Indeed, it was probably about time to take steps there. But we also just want to stress once again that action need to be expected from aviation and maritime. Here too, it is very important to state that aviation and maritime do fall under the Paris Agreement. There was a decision that maybe two other UN bodies could handle this, but maritime and aviation do fall under the Paris commitments. Sometimes some people say that they’re not part of the Paris commitments. I think we need to make that point very clear. For the rest of the resolution, I think it’s very clear on innovation, on competitiveness. It also very much welcomes the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) as part of the ‘Fit for 55’ package, so that this entire package makes very clear that Europe can deliver on the promises it makes, so that we will ensure that in Glasgow we have a leading role. That’s probably our final point. Let this leading role also be seen on some of the sectoral agreements on coal phase-out, the end of the combustion engine. These are the kinds of discussions that are being done in Glasgow as well, and we expect Europe to be at the forefront of that debate.",

The cult of climate change marches on with no definitive evidence to support or deny the factual accuracy of their assertions. Logic suggests that climate change has little to do with this natural catastrophe. Higher human population density, resulting in more discarded cigarettes, sparks from electric transmission lines, campfires and, worst of all, arson are more likely causes of the problem. Traditional Aboriginal managed burning at the right time of year has been shunned or banned without any understanding of the consequences. This Parliament needs to urgently address its own excessive, avoidable carbon footprint by rationalising the waste associated with running three Parliament buildings in different geographic locations. We must end the culture of ‘do as I say, not as I do’, and be judged by what our hands are doing, not by what our mouth is saying. Anything less smacks of do-gooding hypocrisy.

They will send a very clear message to Ukraine and beyond about our continued unwavering support to Ukraine for as long as it takes and our collective strength and resolve in countering Russia’s brutal aggression.  The college—to—government meeting and the summit will provide an opportunity to take stock of the Union’s ongoing support to Ukraine across all areas, including financial, humanitarian, energy, budget support, military support and diplomatic outreach. We will discuss the reform efforts by Ukraine, the further alignment of its legislation with the EU acquis, and we will outline further steps to enhance sectoral cooperation.  Ukraine’s destiny is in Europe. Our common European path was decided last June by granting the status of candidate country to Ukraine. The Commission will support Ukraine throughout the whole accession process, despite the continuing ruthless attacks of the aggressor we are seeing a major momentum of reforms in Ukraine.  Of course, as we well know, the EU accession path is a marathon, not a sprint. The European Council will decide on the next steps unanimously. The discussions in Kiev today and tomorrow will focus on reform priorities and the steps necessary to help Ukraine further align its legislation to the Union acquis, following the Commission’s analytical report which was just published complementing the Commission’s opinion on Ukraine’s EU membership application. To support the reform process and increase Ukraine’s resilience, we are announcing a new support package worth EUR 400 million, including EUR 145 million in humanitarian assistance and EUR 305 million in bilateral cooperation. The Commission also confirmed to the Ukrainian Government that the setting up of the Secretariat of the Multi—agency Donor Coordination Platform in Brussels is progressing well, including preparation for secondments from G7 countries and other partners.  This announcement followed the first meeting, on the 26 January, of the Steering Committee of the Donor Coordination Platform. The coordination platform will be key to help match needs and resources for Ukraine’s repair, recovery and reconstruction efforts.  Ukraine’s accession process works together with its integration of the internal market. The basis of our relationship was already strong, with the Association Agreement and its Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area. The suspension of all tariffs and trade defence measures on Ukraine imports through autonomous trade measures has benefited both sides despite the very difficult circumstances. We will propose to extend these measures soon.  We will also discuss with Ukraine our support across all relevant areas, such as Ukraine’s association to additional EU programmes which will strengthen its economy. Moreover, President von der Leyen will propose a suspension of Ukraine’s financial contributions for participation in Union programmes for as long as Ukraine’s financial challenges remain. As we urgently continue to cut off Russia’s fossil fuel imports, a memorandum of understanding on renewables and gases will also be endorsed. The strategic partnership in this area reflects the significant potential in Ukraine and the high degree of integration of renewables in the energy market and in infrastructure.  Ukraine’s reconstruction cannot be dissociated from Russia’s responsibility for its war of aggression. The atrocities committed by Russia in Ukraine will not go unpunished and all options are on the table to ensure full investigation and prosecution. We support the development of an international centre for the prosecution of the crime of aggressions in Ukraine, in The Hague. The objective would be to coordinate investigations of the crime of aggressions against Ukraine and preserve and store evidence for future trials. This coordination centre would be linked to the existing Joint Investigation team supported by Eurojust.  Russia’s military aggression has shown that Ukraine belongs to Europe. We share the same values, the same aspiration for democracy and freedom, and we will stay united for as long as it takes. ",

The fundamental rights of any European must be the concern of every European, and in 1976, Ireland led by example. You took the UK to court for torturing detainees in Northern Ireland. It was an uphill fight, but time has shown that you were right. Yet decades later, we still see judges using evidence extracted by mistreating detainees. A recent ruling of the European Court of Human Rights ruled that a conviction of 17 years based on a confession extracted in isolation and without counsel was not a fair trial. The man was set free, but last week the Spanish Supreme Court disobeyed and sent him back to jail.  Spain’s disregard for the Strasbourg Court is astonishing. Eleven times they have been condemned for not investigating torture. But guess what? The judge that was blind to abuse and torture in six of these cases, the delinquent judge, Mr Grande-Marlaska, is now Security Minister in Spain.  Taoiseach, the tolerance of the EU authorities to Spanish human rights violation is alarming. We urge you to make your voice and speak clearly about that. We need to hear Ireland’s voice again.

        "speech": " Member of the Commission. – Mr President, our commitment to support human rights defenders, including women’s rights defenders, is a fundamental part of our human rights policy. Unfortunately, in too many countries, including Iran, women continue to face threats and abuse because they are human rights defenders or simply because they are women. They receive defamatory comments and slander. They face hatred, harassment, intimidation and incitement to violence, often of a sexual nature, or they face imprisonment for standing up for their basic rights. In this context, I would like to express how deeply saddened I am by the fate of Sahar Khodayari, who earlier this month set herself on fire after learning that she faced a prison sentence for trying to attend a football match, and who died in the hospital from her wounds. Her tragic death is the heart-breaking aftermath of an appalling contempt for women’s rights. No woman should fear imprisonment for attending a sporting event.  Every year, on 8 May, the international community marks International Women’s Day. For the European Union, this is a time to pay tribute to acts of courage and determination by ordinary women around the world who have played an extraordinary role in the history of their countries and communities. In the joint statement that the EU published on 8 May this year, we stated that we are committed to giving all women and girls equal access to health services, education and economic empowerment and opportunities to shape their own future. We will never stop fighting for true equality for all, inside and outside the European Union, to make sure that progress achieved is not undone. Our commitment to support human rights defenders, including women’s rights defenders, also applies to our work in Iran. In the context of the regular, high-level political dialogue with Iran that aims to advance bilateral cooperation in a number of areas of mutual interest, the European Union has been consistently raising issues of human rights. We have regularly engaged with the authorities to demand that human rights defenders, including women, must not be subjected to harassment or detention.  We have been vocal in this demand, for instance in the case of the 2012 Sakharov Prize laureate Nasrin Sotoudeh, who was sentenced to long periods of imprisonment because of her advocacy for fundamental human rights. And we continue to be vocal, including in international fora such as the United Nations Human Rights Council. The rights of women and girls are also likely to figure prominently during Iran’s upcoming Universal Periodic Review in November. I am acutely aware that the focus of this debate also extends to the situation of EU dual nationals imprisoned in Iran. There again I would like to be clear: the practice of detaining and imprisoning individuals, such as the UK Iranian citizen Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, solely on account of their nationality is contrary to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Iran has ratified and is bound to uphold. Iran’s continued practice of detaining dual nationals clearly breaches the commitment that no one shall be subject to arbitrary arrest or detention. As the European Union, we will continue to call for the release of all EU-Iranian dual nationals and all Iranian human rights defenders. We also call on Iran to ensure that no individual is detained arbitrarily, and that detainees are not subject to any form of mistreatment. Detainees should also have timely access to a lawyer of their own choosing, and to adequate medical care. Honourable Members, thank you for this debate. I can tell you that we are encouraged by the attention paid to these issues by the Members of the European Parliament and we will continue our efforts to work together with you to support human rights defenders across the world.

While the Francisco Franco Foundation remains legal, Spanish judges use anti-hatred laws to prosecute Catalan teachers that criticise the violence of the Civil Guard. We do need laws to protect minorities from hatred but, without democratic judges to enforce them, they are useless. ",

We discussed it in June last year after the Aquarius, we discussed it in January of this year after Sea—Watch and Sea—Eye, and today we are discussing it again. On both previous occasions we were told, as we are today, no more ad hoc solutions. And cynically, in the case of Sea—Watch, the Member States kept their word. There was no ad hoc solution – there was no solution at all. And that is a sad reality for an EU that is based on fundamental values and the principle of solidarity. I agree with the Commissioner: saving lives is not only a legal obligation but a moral one, too. But at the same time we have to realise that the current way in which we are working in the Mediterranean, despite all good intentions, is not only helping to save lives but, at the same time, it unfortunately helps the smugglers who put those lives at risk in the first place. This is something we can no longer allow. There is no silver bullet or single solution to all this. We need a holistic approach – an approach that focuses on better protecting our external borders, that focuses on returning migrants who came illegally to Europe and have no right to stay and an approach that focuses on making agreements with third countries of transit and of origin to help us fight those smuggling networks and to help us prevent migrants from entering in overstuffed and unseaworthy vehicles. Such an approach is the only approach in the long term that can actually save lives.",

        "speech": " Member of the Commission. – Madam President, dear colleagues, I welcome this debate, and I think it’s really important that we’re having an exchange before we have the vote tomorrow, because as some of you have mentioned, we are ahead of many other jurisdictions in this area.  But I want to start by thanking the rapporteurs and to acknowledge the very good cooperation, despite disagreements, to get these files over the line. Let me name Stefan Berger for MiCA, Ernest Urtasun and Assita Kanko for the Transfer of Funds Regulation and, of course, all of the shadow rapporteurs for both files. And I really do want to extend an appreciation for our ECON Chair, Irene Tinagli, who has facilitated this work and, of course, the French Presidency.  We are putting in place comprehensive, tailored rules for crypto-assets in the European Union. No one, I think, in this House questions why these rules are absolutely vital for the financial system. And, as we’ve seen in recent months, stringent rules and supervision are very much needed because we’ve had the collapse of projects such as FTX, Terra Luna, Celsius and Voyager. We’ve seen many retail investors lured in by false promises or false hopes, losing huge amounts of money. And while the crypto market may be too small to trigger systemic risks, we do know that there are increasing links between crypto markets and traditional financial services.  So now to a few elements of our new rules. Firstly, MiCA will bring crypto markets into the regulated space by addressing risks related to consumer protection, market integrity and financial stability. It will also provide legal certainty for market participants that will be able to continue to innovate in a safe environment.  Secondly, it will introduce rules to prevent market abuse of crypto markets such as market manipulation. And we’re bringing crypto asset service providers into the scope of anti-money laundering rules.  Third, under MiCA, crypto-asset service providers like wallet providers or exchangers that serve EU customers will have to be established in the EU and they will be authorised and supervised by national supervisory authorities. MiCA will allow EU-authorised crypto-asset service providers to passport their services throughout the European Union. In return, these operators will be subject to stringent prudential and conduct rules, in addition to rules against insider trading and market manipulation. Crypto-asset service providers will also have to disclose the environmental impact of crypto-assets they offer to customers.  Fourth, the transfer of funds will require all crypto-asset service providers recognised under MiCA to include information about the sender and beneficiary with crypto-asset transfers. This is in full compliance with the Financial Action Task Force international standards on crypto-assets.  Overall, we’re putting safeguards in place that would prevent companies active on the EU market from engaging in some of the practices that led certain crypto-asset operators to collapse in recent months.  After your vote tomorrow, we hope final Council approval and the final signature by the co-legislators will soon follow and we hope for publication by the end of June and entry into force in July of 2023. The new rules will apply progressively. Yes, Markus, I looked for attention from my colleague and I got clarification, thank you. The MiCA provisions on stablecoins will start to apply in July of 2024. The provisions on issuers of other crypto-assets and crypto-asset service providers will start applying in January of 2025, together with the transfer of funds rules. We’re applying these new rules rather progressively, giving stakeholders time to adapt to them, and it gives us time to adopt the secondary legislation for the implementation of the rules.  On a final note, and I think this is very clear to all of us, crypto markets are international and this means that robust rules in the EU are necessary, but other countries need to play their part as well. So I’m very supportive of international regulatory discussions in this area. Indeed, in the US, just last week, we did have useful conversations with our US counterparts about the regulation of crypto markets. So thank you for this debate and I look forward now to listening to all of the contributions. ",

This is why the S&D Group in the European Parliament calls for more ambition coming from the Commission and the Member States in the efforts to implement the multiple programmes and initiatives designed to manage a pandemic, and prepare for future challenges linked to the digital and green transformations. Investing more in healthcare, education and social infrastructure, prioritising research and innovation, supporting our start-ups and SMEs, helping vulnerable groups and promoting gender equality should be an integral part of what we plan for the future of Europe. We call for a citizen-centred EU budget that brings an added value across Europe. We believe that the European Pillar for Social Rights represents a central guiding line for what we want in terms of the relaunch of Europe. The EU budget should therefore allocate proper resources and fully integrate the results of the Porto Social Summit. Through our amendments, we managed to promote a stronger social response to the crisis, coming up with detailed guidelines for what needs to happen in health, education, fighting unemployment, combating poverty, and supporting children and young people, promoting digital skills and the green transformation. We need an inclusive budget that leaves no one behind. The most affected sectors, like tourism and the hospitality sector, the cultural and creative sector, the education and the agricultural sector, should all be referred to with precise policies. We should deal with all the challenges existing at local but also at global level. Therefore I am really happy to see that our amendment calling for Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia to become part of the Schengen area has been taken on board in the final report. All citizens should be at the centre of the MFF and the recovery plan. This is why the European Union should push for a stronger and better answer to the crisis by making sure that all Member States have the capacity to make 2022 a full absorption year. Cohesion in this regard is the key. We cannot repeat the mistakes made at the beginning of the previous MFF. We need to increase transparency, but also reduce the bureaucracy surrounding EU funds. Unfortunately, some governments – like in my own country, Romania – are incapable of preparing a proper answer to the crisis using European funds, and this is where we need to intervene. The European Parliament should be an active actor of this relaunch plan. We are ready to do our part and we should understand that we are in all of this together. It is essential for us to be proactive and respect our commitments in the MFF.  We reiterate our support for the European Child Guarantee, the European Youth Guarantee, the EU4Health programme, the European Social Fund, the Erasmus programme, Creative Europe, and other programmes. The pandemic has shown us that we also need a European health union at the same time. And of course we must also think about our responsibility at global level: our international partners need our help. We are the voice of EU citizens, and we should act as such in the negotiations with the Council and the Commission. Let us work together in finding the best solutions for a social, green, digital and inclusive European budget.",

        "speech": " Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I want to thank first the rapporteur for the presentation of this important report and also for his remarks. Indeed, the demographic challenge is a major challenge for Europe, because the working-age population in the EU has been shrinking for more than a decade and is projected to continue to shrink, and policies that improve employment rates and productivity will therefore be crucial to maintaining economic growth and improve quality of life. The success of our policies, however, should not be measured by whether it reverses this reduction in working age population. Given the current age structure of the EU population, further reductions are inevitable, and many people in the EU will continue to live in areas with a shrinking population. The success of our policies should be measured by whether we can improve economic development and the quality of life in all territories. There are wide variations in demographic trends in Europe between, and within, Member States. Some regions will face sharp population decline, while others will experience steady population growth. To identify the various demographic trends in EU territories, the Commission produced a report on the impact of demographic change in Europe last June and recently launched the Atlas of Demography. Splitting regions into sending and receiving regions, brain drain versus brain gain, is a bit simplistic. It suggests that every movement inevitably produces winners and losers in a Union where movement is one of the main four freedoms, and we had the opportunity to discuss already this important issue. Brain circulation through moves from one place to another can produce both individual and collective benefits. People take the experiences, the education and often their partner with them when they move to a new region or to the region they grew up in. Movement within the EU is not a one-way street. The circulation allows all regions to benefit. In the EU, more people move to rural regions than move out. This shows that on average, rural regions are attractive places to live in, which also benefit from the experience, the income and connections of the people moving in. One-size-fits-all approaches will not work. Regional responses to demographic change must include multiple interventions and integrated approaches. Both rapid growth and rapid decline should lead to adjustments of public services and infrastructure to the needs. A word on cohesion policy instruments to tackle demographic challenges. This Commission is the first one with a portfolio explicitly dedicated to demography. It is already working on demographic change, including aging, and on developing a long-term vision, especially for rural areas, and this long-term vision aims at creating a new momentum specially for rural areas. The competences for relevant policies to deal with the demographic change are to a large extent in the hands of Member States. However, the EU, and cohesion policy in particular, provide key financial levers for structural reforms and support national, regional and local policy-makers in their search for policies dealing with these changes. Cohesion policy already includes multiple provisions to address demographic change. Under the 2014-2020 framework, the specific needs of geographical areas which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps have been given special attention, and measures identified by Member States in cohesion programmes show varieties of responses to demographic challenges. They include measures for boosting connectivity and digitalisation, economic development, reinforcing sustainability by adjusting measures to population shifts, as well as essential infrastructure and services such as childcare facilities, health care and long-term care. Together with the valuable experience of other EU initiatives and structural reforms, rural development, research and innovation or education and training, they can provide inspiration and valuable lessons in order to make best use of all the resources available to support the socio-economic development of depopulated areas. Cohesion policy in 2021-2027 will continue to invest, to tackle demographic challenges and aging in a place-based approach adjusted to the actual needs of territories; to support investments addressing causes and consequences of demographic change under all policy objectives: more competitive and smarter Europe through innovation and digitisation; green and low-carbon Europe – we had the discussion on the Transition Fund; more connected Europe, connectivity and accessibility; more social and inclusive Europe through social infrastructure and services; and finally, a Europe closer to citizens, integrating territorial approaches and local initiatives. Cohesion policy also provides a flexible and adaptable framework to address demographic challenges in a targeted and coordinated manner, while ensuring the participation of territorial authorities and local stakeholders. Smart specialisation strategies help local partners identify regional assets and develop them in a cooperative process. Moreover, a dedicated policy objective and instruments to integrate territorial and local development will be available to support local actors and exploit new opportunities, developing links between rural areas and cities, economic diversification of rural areas through the common agricultural policy – access to services, including digital services, is of crucial importance to assist regions to become more innovative and competitive and improve the quality of life for citizens and especially keep these citizens in the territories, which is the major aim. Negative population trends are often accelerated as a result of the decline of certain sectors, again coming back to the Just Transition Fund. Here we have really to use this tool to prevent that the decline of certain sectors goes together with the decline of population, causing regions to become a less attractive place to live and work. So this is what we have to do to give new opportunities to this region. Therefore the Just Transition mechanism is so important. Cohesion policy can support investment in all these areas. Technical support through the Technical Support Instrument can complement cohesion policy to increase labour market participation of the long-term unemployed youth, older people or migrant integration in the labour market. The Commission can provide technical support to Member States that wish to undertake reforms in all these areas. When developing their partnership agreement and programmes, affected Member States need to identify their demographic challenges and specific needs of regions and areas – in particular, disadvantaged areas – and set out an integrated approach to address them, depending on the resources and other policy measures. Member States will even have the possibility to earmark dedicated funding. As a result, causes and consequences of demographic change can be specifically addressed. It is now the responsibility of each Member State to propose a set of measures to tackle the challenges of depopulated areas during the negotiations of future cohesion policy programmes that are currently taking place in order to make best use of all the resources available to support the socio-economic development of all areas, and particularly of depopulated areas.",

While the number of road deaths fell by an unprecedented 17% in 2020, this was due largely to lower traffic volumes as a result of the pandemic. The figure of 19 000 fatalities across the EU remains unacceptably high. In the sustainable and smart mobility strategy, the Commission reiterated its commitment to implementing the EU road safety policy framework and bringing down to close to zero the death toll for all modes of transport.  However, I want to stress that the Vision Zero is a joint responsibility. Success will depend on all of us playing our part from European, national and regional and local authorities, to police and health services, from all road users, employers to bike share operators, to car makers. We all have an interest in making our roads safer in partnership. I can assure you the Commission is working very closely with the Member States to ensure an effective implementation of the safe-system approach throughout Europe.  Ms Kountoura’s report includes a number of constructive proposals and recommendations to which the Commission will give due consideration. I shall highlight a few of these issues.  The Commission fully agrees that road safety is an integral part of sustainable and smart mobility. There can be no sustainability without safety. As we build transport infrastructure, we need it to be both green and safe. When we improve the infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians for instance, we both encourage reduction of our carbon footprint, healthy active mobility and we make it safer.  Indeed, as the EU becomes more urban, road safety is becoming increasingly an urban question, and vulnerable road users, pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists now account for 70% of traffic fatalities in our cities. Much of our current focus is on preparing a new legislative package, including revisions of the Driving Licence Directive and the directive on cross-border enforcement of traffic rules.  We will also update the rules on roadworthiness where we will be looking both at emissions and safety elements, as well as odometer fraud. And we are also looking closely into factors such as speed and alcohol consumption and reflecting on possible EU recommendations to address them. More specifically on speed, we take note of the Parliament’s position and the strong engagement of stakeholders at global and local level. We are looking very closely into this issue, in particular assessing the gains for road safety in those European cities which set a maximum speed of 30 km per hour in residential areas. We are also working closely with our partners to ensure that EU funding can be targeted towards road safety projects.  Of course, better infrastructure is a key factor in improving road safety. We have encouraged investment in road safety upgrades as part of the Recovery and Resilience Facility. European Investment Bank loans, structural and cohesion funds and the Connecting Europe Facility also provide additional avenues to incentivise actions in this field.  The Commission is also grateful to the European Parliament for its support for the European Road Safety Exchange, which is a twinning project bringing safety professionals from different EU Member States together to help address specific road safety problems. The feedback today has been very positive. We are making good progress on establishing a first set of key road safety performance indicators based on a common methodology, and we expect the first set of results next year.  We look forward to engaging with the Member States and the Parliament to help shape future work. We have also relaunched an important European road safety tool, the European Road Safety Charter. This is a huge network of over 3 000 people, organisations, civil society and companies with an interest in road safety. It offers a perfect opportunity to share and reward good practice and to learn from each other.  The 2021 EU Road Safety Awards ceremony will take place on 18 November, and Parliament is invited to help us make this event a real success. The Commission fully shares the need for EU road safety policy to be adaptable to change, in particular with regard to the development of automated vehicles.  An EU partnership under Horizon Europe on connected, cooperative and automated mobility has been set up to promote and facilitate large-scale testing in this field. Our goal is to enable the safe introduction of automation on EU roads. The work of the partnership will go hand-in-hand with policy and legislative updates needed to take full advantage of these developments for safer, more sustainable and inclusive mobility.  The Commission takes note of your proposals for staging a European year of road safety and the creation of a new agency for road transport. We recognise the potential benefits of both, but also need to consider the costs, of course. We will continue to reflect on these options and report back to you on progress achieved.  Once again, I thank the rapporteur, Ms Kountoura, and the shadows for preparing this important report, and the Commission looks forward to its adoption in plenary later this week.",

I would like to go back to Moria. I cannot do so, but it is as much about the people in the camp as it is about us and the people we aspire to be, and the values we aspire to protect. ",

We were working on all the instruments like the MFF, like Next Generation EU, like the cohesion policy and the other elements, which will be based on solidarity and dedicated to a more resilient Europe.  As a representative of the EPP, I don’t want just to say what we think about the European Commission work programme, but I would just underline some of the elements we think as EPP are the most important. What do we expect? We expect more resilience towards the foreign interference and the attacks against democratic values and our way of life and reinforcement in the fight against corruption and the rule of law. But when we speak about the priorities, the main strategic objectives, there are several we think are most important, but let me just describe it as one main element, which is recovery. Recovery, because for us, there’s some elements which are the basis for the recovery. This is recovery and resilience, this is a question of the Green Deal but also digitalisation. All of them are the part of the main strategic goal, which is recovery.  When we speak about economic recovery, we should be concentrating on developing a convincing exit strategy that moves from the more targeted support measures to eventual phasing out and to address the issue of how to deal with the high levels of government debt accumulated during the crisis, and coordination policy removing tax-related obstacles to the single market. When we speak about the Green Deal, we would like to underline the question of the reduction of administrative costs and the regulatory burden and principle in connection with environment policy.  When we speak about digitalisation I think we should be concentrating on the question of education, administration, health and all the related challenges. So please, Commissioner, take also our remarks to show that the programme of the Commission is also dedicated and oriented towards the most important goals for the European Union.",

Now, this year, the circumstances under which we are negoitating the annual budget for the next year are even more dramatic. Europe gave a clear answer to the unprovoked, brutal Russian aggression and took a stance together with the brave people of Ukraine. We all feel, we all see that a new and different Europe is being shaped by the war and that a new Europe is emerging, one that has to focus on key priorities and sound policies. This definitely means focusing on securing energy supplies, continued investment in security and defence and support for humanitarian aid, but also preventing the new migration crisis. The announced joint procurement act for the European defence industry is the right incentive for cooperation between the Member States, as well as for the industry that has been mobilised like never before. Likewise, with the European chips act, we have the possibility to increase Europe's independence with regard to semiconductor production in times when global supply chains are significantly disrupted.  But all these efforts require an appropriate budgetary architecture. They all require the revision of the MFF. This is something that is urgent, this is something that is crucial. In the end, this can only be achieved if Parliament is united in its message for this, but also for this annual budget.

A safety net provided by the EU for what is a European shame. Ironic. The absolutist approach of banning abortion entirely shows no compassion for women nor for their bodily integrity or faith in them to make their own decisions. Mr Kaczynski, are you so afraid of Polish women that you seek to keep them under your control? Pregnancy can be a joyous and happy occasion, but it can also be complex. And as humans, as dignified citizens, we must understand that complexity, and have flexibility for the circumstances that are not clear cut, like fatal foetal abnormality – where a much-longed-for child cannot survive.

However, it pains me to see what’s happening in Kashmir. Kashmir is in crisis: an international and human rights crisis. The people of Kashmir have suffered, and continue to suffer. The EU is an organisation which proudly stands for human rights, right across the world, and we must stand today with the people of Kashmir.  The ongoing crisis in Kashmir threatens the peace and security of the wider region – one of the most volatile in the world. It’s our responsibility to do something. The recommendations of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR)  offer a good starting point for their actions. We must support them and implement the findings of their reports, which they published last year in June and this year in July.  The institutions of the EU and their Member States exist not only to protect the human rights of citizens in the European Union, but they must also be defenders of human rights across the globe. The situation in Kashmir will not improve by trying to blame either side: all the while people try to apportion blame, the people of Kashmir are suffering and deserve better. The people of Kashmir should be the ones who decide their fate and their future. Self—determination and upholding human rights are fundamental values in our European Union, and we should demand no less from others around the world – particularly those that want to trade and have relationships with us.  The fighting in Kashmir has been going on for decades, but, in the end, the crisis is going to be ended only when people sit around the table and talk. The EU can be a natural facilitator in this role, and that allows both sides to talk. The people of Kashmir are crying out in the darkness. The EU must help them provide a light in that darkness. ",

        "speech": " President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, thank you for the opportunity to once again discuss with you the conference on the future of Europe; a reflection that today seems more important than ever in view of the unprecedented challenges our Union is facing. The situation has no doubt radically changed since we last had a chance to discuss the issue in this plenary back in January. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has, in the meantime, left deep marks on our societies and economies, leaving no one and nothing unaffected, including the plans we had for the conference.  For obvious reasons over the last few weeks and months, we had to focus our attention on the most pressing priorities for our citizens; foremost the health emergency and its economic and social consequences. If anything, however, the crisis has shown us how important it is to reflect together on the future of our Union. The Presidency therefore remains strongly committed to reaching a consensus in the Council as soon as possible, with the aim of finding an agreement with Parliament and the Commission on the timing and manner of launching the conference and on its overall concept. However, I want to strongly underline that we are doing our best to find swift agreement in the Council on this important issue. That work is still ongoing and has intensified over the last week at COREPER, ministerial and other high political levels. On 9 May, in his address to mark Europe Day, the Croatian Prime Minister, Mr Plenković, stressed the paramount value of the future of Europe open debates with our citizens and other stakeholders for shaping the vision of our common European future. He invited all EU Member States to reach a consensus as soon as possible, as well as the agreement with Parliament and the Commission.  On 26 May, the Presidency also included a discussion on the conference on the agenda of the informal videoconference of Ministers of European Affairs.  As it emerged from these exchanges, the design of the conference will of course need to take into account the recent developments. The Presidency is therefore working on the revised text of the Council’s position in order to also reflect the COVID-19 reality.  We take note of Parliament’s new resolution on the conference on which you will vote in this plenary which similarly seeks to reflect the new reality. At the same time, we believe that the nature of the conference should not fundamentally change in the light of the pandemic. The conference should contribute to the development of our policies in the medium and long term, so that we can better tackle current and future challenges while taking into account as many views of different stakeholders as possible.  While the lessons of the COVID-19 crisis should be included in our reflection, we also consider that the crisis has further highlighted the importance of the already identified priorities of the 2019-2024 strategic agenda. These priorities range from strengthening our single market to successfully delivering the green and digital transition, and delivering concrete results for the benefit and well-being of our citizens. Most importantly, we remain convinced that the upcoming conference should be an inclusive process involving our three institutions in full respect of the interinstitutional balance and of our respective roles. Likewise, Member States should be involved equally, including their national parliaments, and shared ownership remains important.  Finally, let me reiterate that to deliver on our priorities, as well as defining a vision of Europe in 10 to 20 years, cooperation among institutions will be imperative. As the coronavirus crisis has reminded us all, divisions make us weaker. Only by overcoming them will we be able to proactively shape our future. ",

I hope, however, that the Treaty’s shortcomings do not blind us from seeing how much we need a modernised treaty to cover renewable energy investments. The Commission estimation shows that for reduction of emissions by the goals we have set, the EU needs annually EUR 350 billion more energy-related investments than were made in the past 10 years. It is clear also that most of this will come from private investors. If we get the true ambitious modernisation that is sought in the EU text proposal, the ECT would then, in effect, become the enforcement tool for the Paris Agreement that we currently lack.  We should recognise that in the multilateral investment treaty covering renewable energy investments, and that no other treaty exists than the ECT. With the modernised treaty we could offer private investors protection and the stable investment environment that is needed to increase investments in renewables. It will not be easy to find an ambitious modernised treaty – unanimity is required among 54 parties to the agreement – but we have to push this and we have to convince our partners that all need an Energy Charter Treaty that is in line with the Green Deal.

Or maybe German political interference in Hungary, Poland or perhaps in Croatia?  I am asking you this because, for instance, a Swedish company owns the biggest economic daily newspaper in Slovenia. Another big Slovenian paper is owned partially by Austrians, and one of its commercial TV channels is now in Czech hands. Or let me tell you that RTL Klub, a popular TV channel in Hungary, is owned entirely by the German RTL Group. Believe it or not, 80% of regional papers in Poland and 60% of the print media in Croatia are also in German hands. Doesn’t this give you a hard time sleeping at night? Well, it should not.  These companies have invested their capital into media products in other Member States for profit, in line with one of the most basic principles of this community: the freedom of movement of capital. The same is true for North Macedonia: investments are private business matters for media companies, and they have nothing to do with politics. This one-sided criticism which is always directed at countries with conservative governments is hypocritical and absurd, and it really shouldn’t feature on the agenda of the European Parliament.

For the third year in a row, I have left these negotiations with a curious realisation. Some EU capitals fundamentally reduce these negotiations to how much they have to pay and seem very often to disregard what they actually get for it, their return on investment. In light of this, it may be worth going back to why we actually have a European Union budget. We have it because, some time ago, Presidents and Prime Ministers made a confession, collectively, rationally and out of political self-interest. They made the confession that, in the past, conflicting national interests have led us to radicalisation and, ultimately, war. They made the confession that every nation, however grand and historically powerful, is too small to tackle the issues of our time alone. I would say they made the confession that all our individual nations lost part of their sovereignty exactly because, alone, they cannot safeguard or represent their citizens’ rights when it comes to climate change, healthcare, rising energy prices, leadership and research, global trade, national security and so many other fields which we see represented in our budget. This is why we have a common European budget, and this is why we have a common European institution that helps us thrive and regain some of the sovereignty that our individual nation states have lost. But let’s get back to the content of next year’s budget. From Parliament’s side, the final outcome, as Karlo Ressler has said, is a success. We have barely ever seen such a focused budget underlining our priorities, be it in the fight against climate change, in our solidarity via vaccination campaigns and in supporting our research excellence, just to name a couple of examples. So big congratulations to Karlo and all his colleagues and shadow rapporteurs for the great work.  On my side of the table, when it comes to strengthening the institutions of the European Union, I believe we have also achieved quite a lot. First of all, this is true for the European Court of Justice. Justice is always on the side of the weak and the persecuted. Strengthening the Court with additional staff and funds therefore means safeguarding the weakest in our societies against those abusing positions of power, and that is always worth it. Second, we were able to reinforce the Court of Auditors to scrutinise the correct spending of the billions flowing by the European Recovery Instrument. A common responsibility requires hard checks and balances, and the Court is crucial in this regard. Third, I’m also very happy that we were able to reinforce the capacities of Parliament, of this House. After years of increased workload, we have finally managed to strengthen our core legislative capacities, which will improve the quality of legislation for all European citizens.  Let me close by thanking the Council Presidency for their fair negotiations and the Commissioner for very creative solutions, Karlo for the great collaboration, Johan for the calm advice, and my shadows for the continuous support throughout the negotiations, but also to my team – Caroline, Zita and Johannes – for their hard work over the last year.

By choosing to counter the Ukraine invasion with economic sanctions, one could not expect to succeed in the short run, when the state against which sanctions are being enforced is prepared to bear a 20% decline in national income or more. Meanwhile, European governments face a decline in their national income by at least 2%. They will seek to cushion the shocks, especially on the low income strata of their populations. In doing so, they should not allow free market hang—ups to blur their interventions. Second—round effects of the war will entail higher energy costs, fiscal impacts, cyberattacks and disruption of supply chains as we head towards an 8% to 22% increase in food prices alone over the next two years. This will undermine social and financial stability in the EU. Coordination between Member States of national support plans will be of paramount importance.

It establishes clear rules for companies to ensure products sold to EU consumers meet strict deforestation—free requirements. It includes human rights protections and extends the scope to several more commodities and products. It extends the scope from only deforestation to also include degradation of forests and other wooded lands. It also includes the financial sector.

It is evident that the EU Member States, at this moment, unfortunately, do not have enough leverage to combat this practice. We cannot let ourselves be put in a situation where we pay large sums, or release terrorists, or become silent because of a lack of a strategy on countering hostage taking and blackmailing. We have all witnessed how the oppressive regimes, such as the one in Iran and others, use hostages as diplomatic tools. While some European citizens have been released through lengthy negotiations – which is important, of course, and which saved lives – our Member States, however, lack the leverage to effectively combat hostage diplomacy. I have myself recently met with a lot of the family members of hostages taken in Iran and learned about the unbelievable human suffering that the Iranians’ hostage diplomacy causes. To be silent and continue with the status quo cannot and must never be an option for us in the European Union, because these horrendous regimes are bullies: when they know that one certain behaviour is successful for them, they continue to practice the same. But I also want to say that I do believe that one of the core problems is also the lack of a joint EU foreign policy in some fields. The only way the EU can really become stronger in that, against the oppressing regimes, is when the latter know that the EU is not talking with 27 different votes on foreign policies, but rather with a joint one. Nevertheless, the EU must respond against authoritarian regimes that are using innocent human beings as a means to pressure our freedoms and human rights. I therefore think it is essential that we have a European strategy to counter hostage diplomacy and improve our cooperation to release all EU citizens and to ensure that the regimes cannot continue using this hostage diplomacy as a tool over and over again.

I think what we have discussed this evening is about the concrete situations of millions of European citizens, about their pains, about their suffering, about their difficulties and the effort the European Union has made to mitigate these difficulties and these pains.  Although we should not forget that this pandemic has taken away thousands of lives, it’s not the lockdown that took people’s lives, it’s the virus. I want to say – and this has been said by the President very clearly this morning – there is only one way out, and that’s vaccination. The European Union has made tremendous efforts to make sure that vaccines are available for everyone and that vaccination is accessible for everybody.  We must unfortunately note that very often there is also inequality at that level in our countries. We have to fight for getting as many people vaccinated as possible. We are not yet there. We are good in some countries and we are not good in others. There is a necessity for all of us to make this effort, otherwise we will have to deal with remaining economic, but also social, problems and really also problems of families, which will be plunged into grief, into suffering.  I cannot go into detail on all the questions. Yes, this has been also a crisis of psychology. That’s right. Especially the young have been affected and remain affected. Again, we have to help them now to find a new stability, a job. When we talk about a ‘Year for the Young’ it’s not just a nice formula, but we have to come up with very concrete solutions. Everybody has to take the responsibility that the recovery is the recovery for all, and especially also a recovery for the young generation. That’s the meaning of the year 2020, the Year of the Young or of Youth.  Certainly it’s about people, it’s not about money. But money nevertheless is important, and I just want to mention that one of the first decisions which was taken, on a proposal by the Commission, was finally to suspend the Stability and Growth Pact. Imagine for one second if this had not been done. By the way, we also introduced very high flexibility in the funds and the use of the funds, the CRII 1 and 2, and Parliament was very helpful to pass these measures very, very rapidly. So this was also a very important measure to give countries the money to act rapidly and to target the immediate consequences of this pandemic, which was an event nobody could really foresee and expect. FEAD was increased, for the most vulnerable and the most deprived – and suddenly many people became deprived, even those who never, never expected to be deprived, were deprived.  One word on companies. Yes, I agree there are also small companies, certain sectors, suffering a lot. But here also measures were taken. All Member States were encouraged to support self—employed people, and SURE was not excluding the self—employed. Some countries did it by the way, and also for small companies to allow them to survive.  Yes, we will come up with a recommendation on the Directive on minimum income next year, 2022, and the idea of a permanent SURE is still under study and has not been abandoned.",

Despite the volume of the discharge, as we look at the spending of EUR 170 billion, it is more a dialogue of the deaf rather than a constructive exchange. Error rate is still above the 2% target, and for the 27th time the Court of Auditors is unable to grant a positive statement to the implementation of the EU budget. The financial sustainability is at risk. The outstanding budgetary commitments are now more than EUR 340 billion. Yet not everything is in the numbers; key issues for us are transparency and rule of law. That is what we owe to our taxpayers. It is the Commission’s primary task as the guardian of the Treaties to protect these norms and values. To put it simply: no EU money if no EU standards. The Commission never seriously used its tool to uphold the rule of law across the Union. If we compromise on the fundamentals, then the whole European House will fall apart. The first step against Hungary must not become the fig leaf for inaction excuses, but a booster that will strongly show our determination. No EU money if no EU standards. Then we have another crucial occurring challenge: the list of all final beneficiary. The Commission needs to set up a system that allows to see the complete list: who gets how much and how often. That is how to find conflict of interests, land grabbing, misuse of agri and cohesion funds as we witness the growing oligarch structures abusing EU funds in some of the Member States. It is not in the interest of either us here in the European Parliament or taxpayers’ interest to create the next oligarch generation with the NextGenerationEU money.",

It is heavily regulated but still it is a market, and as a result of that we can see that the demand for electricity has increased unexpectedly but the supply is not reacting appropriately and winter is approaching. That is why the prices are very, very high. According to market data, they should drop down later on, but it does not mean that the situation is not very, very serious.  What can we do in the short run, before we increase our supply capacities? First of all, I guess we should fully use our capacities on the gas market, especially in the terms of storage. If they are not sufficient, we should increase them. Second, we should improve the capacity assessment on the electricity market and especially pay attention to the situation when we are decommissioning the resources, to be ready to replace them. Last but not least, we can consider if the ETS market should be added to with some kind of price stabilising mechanism to avoid excessive fluctuation.",

This is cohesion policy, and it was mentioned by many of you. There is a broad agreement that cohesion policy remains an essential policy, precisely to give all the regions in the European Union good opportunities. Unfortunately, we are not from the same starting point. Many regions have handicaps for geographical or other reasons, and that’s why cohesion policy is the other side of the coin of the internal market. This was conceived when… under… I think it was mainly Jacques Delors who conceived the cohesion policy. This was the approach: there is the internal market, but there is also the corrective arm, and this is the cohesion policy. I’m very grateful that has been has been supported very clearly also in this debate, because this is also the glue which keeps us together in spite of all the differences – that’s the European solidarity. Now, the question is: what are the best tools? Here, I heard many messages, very important messages, and the point is there are some differences also. How can we do best for all regions, all European regions to have the best opportunities economically, socially, job opportunities? How can we keep people in these regions? Because this is very important also, I would say, for political, for demographic, but even in some way, for strategic reasons, to keep people in these outermost regions. Now, I’ve taken the case of the fishermen. Well, I’ve checked it. There is one case, but it is not depending on state aid. It is maybe… there is another issue about the fish policy or policy in this area. But we, I, will continue to look at this. I think it is a very important element and what you have said. Well, there are some divergences also, which I have heard, because the fact is that Member States are not equal when we are talking about state aid. There are those who can give a lot of state aid and those who have less capacity to give state aid, so that’s also an issue we cannot just put aside. Now, as I have already said, the de minimis regulation is under review, and I think your remarks, your contribution, should at least be taken on board during this review. Now, I want just to recall some basic elements which are, I think, very important. First, regional aid and especially linked to investment aid – regional aid rules allow Member States now to support investments in disadvantaged areas so the most disadvantaged areas can get support from state aid. The most disadvantaged areas are automatically qualified as ‘a’-areas depending on the objective criteria (low level of GDP compared to EU average), and outermost regions are automatically considered as ‘a’-areas. For instance, SMEs can receive aid in outermost regions that covers more than 75% of the investment cost specially linked to SMEs, and we all know that the economic structures in these areas are mainly based on SMEs. ‘C’—areas can be selected by each Member State and approved by the Commission on the basis of criteria listed in the regional aid guidelines. Regional aid rules also allow for operating aid, as I have seen, and here also outermost regions can have specific regimes on operating aid.",

The war has already shut down the production of electric cars in a number of Member States, including the Czech Republic, due to the electric parts that go into connecting batteries to the vehicles being blocked. As vehicle manufacturers struggle to find new sources of supplies, we must prevent a similar problem in the future with the batteries themselves. That is why this legislation should help support better production and recycling in Europe, so that, in the future, we have a safe supply of raw and recycled materials.  At the same time, this legislation must not be used as a tool against a global supply chain. When we are not faced with a crisis, the best source of many batteries and battery materials will continue to be outside the European Union. I firmly believe that we must work with other international players, including in the UN Economic Commission of Africa (ECA) Forum, as we implement this legislation towards making these rules universal and not for Europe alone.  As we move towards a future of electric vehicles, the question of batteries will not be a question of AA or AAA batteries. We need a plan for what to do with these huge car and truck batteries. The car industry must be a partner in this and our laws must be able to be implemented. As we go into trilogues, I ask all sides to make sure this law will work in practice. Only if we work with the industry will we get this right. ",

However, most of the Western Balkan countries have recognised the dangers to their peoples constituted by organised crime, and have already implemented a number of required legal, institutional and political measures in order to able to successfully combat it. But no question, more has to be done.

We failed to set up a real asylum system and we looked away from the misery in Syria.  Finally, last week EU leaders acknowledged the urgency of this crisis.

Indeed, the European Union is founded on the values of respect for freedom, equality and respect for human rights. Today, things are changing and we discuss public discrimination of LGBTI people in the heart of the European Union. What we are seeing more and more is a rise of the public endorsement of anti—LGBTI propaganda and LGBTI—free zones, even from mayors.

I think now it’s needed more than at any time in European history and I think that your decisiveness in presenting the Franco-German proposal has opened the possibilities for the European Commission to present to all of you the unprecedented proposal where we are looking at how we can best combine the next seven-year budget, the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) with the Next Generation EU instrument. I will not go into detail because I think that the next debate will be very much focused on that and that we will also have a chance to debate it with the President of the European Council, Mr Michel. So let me go a little bit in the other direction – into what else which will be so crucial to the German Presidency. Madam Chancellor, I very much appreciate your strong words on European values, on the importance of solidarity, on underscoring how important fundamental rights are and the fact – which sometimes we forget in the heated debates we very often have in the Council – that cohesion is the sustainable investment into the future and that the successful projects in our Member States are making the whole European economy much stronger, much more resilient for the future. I think this is exactly what you need. I think you saw from the Chamber how much your clear stance on fighting dangerous populism and hatred and the push for rule of law is appreciated by this House and by this Chamber.  I think that we both lived large parts of our lives under a regime where we were longing for freedom, longing for the possibility to travel across Europe. Therefore, maybe for us, it’s a little bit different when we talk about the importance of democracy, about sensitivity for freedoms, about the importance of the Schengen system being restored as quickly as possible, because we know how it was when we didn’t have that opportunity.  So, whatever happens next week, and of course we are all very hopeful and optimistic that we will clinch the historic deal for the European Union, the German Presidency will coincide with the fateful moment in this European debate and in our history. I think if the European Council reaches an agreement, then the real work will start and we will have ahead of ourselves, together with you, a frantic semester of legislative activity to make sure that this investment can indeed re-energise Europe and revitalise the European economy to make it greener, cleaner, more digital and more resilient. And, to answer to my good colleague, Ismail Ertug, I believe that batteries will also be very high on the list of priorities.  To conclude, I would like to thank all of you for this very important debate and to thank Chancellor Merkel for a very ambitious programme for the next six months, which I know had to be adjusted because of the COVID crisis realities. But I believe that today, and in the next week, we will reach a very important agreement which will open a new chapter in European history, a new chapter in European integration. ",

That a German, a Maltese, a Pole and a Latvian national could walk down the street in a village in Poland and expect the same rights and the same level of protection.

        "speech": " President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, honourable Members, Commissioner, the European Union and the Member States are deeply concerned by the passing of an anti-homosexuality bill by the Uganda Parliament, which introduces severe punishment for same—sex intimacy, including the death penalty. These concerns have been conveyed to members of the Ugandan Government and Parliament during the process of adoption of this bill. Bilaterally, several EU Member States have also expressed their strong concerns with the consequences of this law. The criminalisation of homosexuality is contrary to international law and violates the enjoyment of human rights by LGBTI persons. It reinforces and legitimises existing stereotypes, increases the risk of stigmatisation, discrimination and violence, and can make LGBTI persons more vulnerable to human rights violations and abuses. Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, and 2023 marks its 75th anniversary. Equality and non-discrimination are core values enshrined in the EU Treaties and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The European Union is committed to fighting all forms of discrimination, including on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity, and continues to actively promote and protect the human rights of LGBTI persons, as Prime Minister Bettel of Luxembourg so strongly reminded us today in his speech here in the Chamber.  It is important to recall that the African Union also shares these values, and that the African Union Commission condemned violence and other human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The EU will continue to work constructively with partners in Africa to counteract and denounce all discriminatory laws, policy and practices, including the criminalisation of consenting same—sex relations and, in particular, the use of the death penalty, torture or ill treatment in this respect. The human rights of LGBTI persons remain part of the EU’s diplomacy efforts in bilateral relations and in multilateral fora. The EU will continue to work with and support civil society organisations working for increased respect for human rights, including those protecting and promoting the enjoyment of human rights by LGBTI persons. I’m looking forward to this debate, but thank you for the attention.",

Here is how the contract with Moderna was disclosed to us, to the public and to the media. (The speaker held up a collection of papers) This is simply unacceptable! The EU Court of Auditors reported that through these contracts, Ursula von der Leyen has committed to purchase 4.6 billion doses of injections for a total cost of EUR 71 billion. Ursula von der Leyen could have given EUR 150 for every person in the EU to help recover after the pandemic and it would have been more effective than purchasing worthless injections. Ursula von der Leyen knew from the beginning that these injections are ineffective since she committed to purchase over ten doses of injections for every person in the EU, while she claimed that, with one such injection, a person will receive immunity from COVID. In any private company, a leading manager who signed such an abusive contract would have been fired effective immediately without seeing the full and unredacted versions of these contracts, no responsible MEP who cares about the people and their money can vote for the discharge of the European Commission.

Its strong message is a testimony to the cross-party commitment to stand with the Uyghurs and all those whose human dignity and freedoms are being violated every day. Just in the recent years, the Chinese Communist Party has built an Orwellian state that has introduced mass surveillance, engaged in forced organ-harvesting from prisoners of conscience, forced sterilisation, forced labour, and has placed over one million Uyghurs in the concentration camps. It systematically destroyed thousands of churches, mosques and other places of worship and culture. It behaves with increasingly brute force across mainland China and Hong Kong, and threatens and bullies Taiwan and countries around the globe. Moreover, Cardinal Bo said rightly that ‘it is the oppression, the lies and corruption of the CCP that are responsible’ for the current pandemics. Dear colleagues, it is the right time to re-think our relationship with China, ensuring a value-based and consistent approach towards the Chinese Communist Party. We must understand that our values do not hinder our policies – but policies that ignore our values do. If the EU wants to have credibility as a global actor, it must ensure a consistent value-based foreign policy. That must mean seeing the Chinese Communist Party for what it is, while engaging positively with the Chinese people. That must mean standing with the Uyghurs, Hongkongers, Tibetans, and all those oppressed by the Chinese Communist Party. That must mean clear consequences for the suppression of human dignity and freedoms, such as imposing targeted sanctions. That must mean upholding corporate responsibility through due diligence in our supply chains and banning the import of all products made by forced labour. That must mean working closely with our democratic allies in addressing human rights violations across mainland China and Hong Kong, and coordinating our policies on sanctions, import bans and other measures to send a clear message: we will defend human dignity.

We are just over 200 days since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Apart from the human tragedy that Putin has caused, the war has triggered volatility, and uncertainty on our energy markets and the threat of gas disruption this winter is a scenario to be ready for. At the same time, we have seen images of extreme weather affecting our lives and stressing our energy system, and this keeps repeating over and over again. Both of these developments need a response and action that is even more robust than before. Energy savings are the quickest and cheapest way to address the current energy crisis. This is key, as high energy costs are hitting our vulnerable consumers and businesses most.  Saving energy directly reduces our energy bills and makes our economy more resilient. Energy efficiency means saving on energy prices, investment costs and system costs. But it needs to be done right – e.g. will complement the urgent action we are taking to reduce gas consumption in view of our REPowerEU goals, just like we already see with our ‘Save gas for a safe winter’ plan.  As you know, electricity demand reduction will be the starting point of the emergency intervention that we are currently finalising. Beyond this winter, structural change at the very foundation of how we use energy every day will help end our dependence on Russian fossil fuels faster and protect our economy.  In this way, energy efficiency is a strategic tool to strengthen and safeguard our energy system. Given its importance, I want to thank the rapporteur, Nils Fuglsang, and his colleagues from the ITRE Committee for the important progress made on the proposal. You have shown a true commitment to pushing for the highest ambition in many of the provisions to effectively alleviate energy poverty.  On the way forward, I would stress the importance of a robust and effective EEG, otherwise we risk undermining its impact, in particular when it comes to the provisions on public buildings and innovation and stopping support to fossil fuel technologies. I hope that we can stick to the spirit of the proposal. The current crisis and the challenging winter ahead will remain a constant reminder of the importance of our joint effort on this proposal, with a collective, constructive mind—set. ",

At the same time, they are also by national, European and international law obliged to protect borders and to fight criminal networks, smuggling and exploiting the most vulnerable ones. Even more so when these networks are state sponsored – an instrument like migratory flows – like done by Erdogan or Lukashenko. In this sense, this obligation is even more crucial when we speak about European borders, because then Schengen and our four freedoms rely on that. No doubt it is a sensitive balance, and we witnessed just yesterday in plenary a government that does not live up to our expectations. But there are other Member States working together smoothly with European support, answering hybrid attacks together, cooperating with the Commission on alleged cases. And because it is a sensitive balance, we need to make a few things clear. Let’s not expect from our officers, European or national, land or sea border, to first open up a legal review of complex questions when acting on our behalf. The principle of non—refoulement is, of course, to be respected, but neither does it mean that access to a procedure can be practically applied at every inch of the border, nor does it mean that everyone asking for protection is eligible for that. And see, and this is the key. It is on us finding the right balance politically, legally and enforceable under difficult circumstances. Half-way to that is a pact screening border procedure, the crisis mechanism which prepares us better. The second part is the upcoming revision of the Schengen Border Code. But the need for better coordination – measures to prevent manipulated crossings – instruments to trigger in critical situations.

Major challenges exist in this respect. Interlinkages between the goals mean that progress in one area can have repercussions on another.

As the EU presents its first voluntary review this year, the EU must stand up and show real leadership in the implementation of the SDGs to deliver the 2030 Agenda.

That’s why we commend the Commission Work Programme and your work, Mr Vice-President, in its preparation. But let me be clear on our priorities.  The Recovery Plan and the MFF cannot be stalled. They are crucial for the economic rebound. Also, the Health Union has to be delivered properly. And we must speed up on the digital and green transitions. But we will deceive ourselves if we think that they have no consequences for the people. They should not go forward without a red heart in them.  In that regard, we salute the Commission’s compromise to present an action plan to ensure the full implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights, but we need more. We need to fight poverty and protect European workers. Many will be vulnerable to the digital transformation. Energy poverty must be addressed or it will be just worsened by the green transition.  The European Union has to do whatever it takes to assure that the recovery and the twin transitions are fair, effective and long lasting. That implies tax fairness across Europe, flexibility on the fiscal rules to be kept for several years, and also that previous rules must change, avoiding pressure over Member States to introduce austerity measures, as it happened 10 years ago with all the consequences we know. By opposite, measures providing a stabilisation function, such as the Unemployment Reinsurance Scheme, must be really implemented.  It is through solidarity that Europe will prevail. Solidarity amongst people, regions and Member States. Solidarity with migrants that need safe and legal paths. Solidarity and values. Fighting for real gender equality. Promoting the rule of law, our values, the SDGs in Europe and all over the world.

I’d like to thank the 17.4 million Brexit voters who put ‘Great’ back into Britain and to remind the EU we are GB plc, we’re not a subsidiary of the EU Parliament. Yet the largest plebiscite the UK has ever had is being betrayed. We have a Remain Prime Minister, we have a Remain cabinet and we have a Remain Opposition led by terrorist-supporting Marxist. What a choice! But the 17.4 million people said we’re better than that, and they deserve better than that. Together with our greatest allies, the USA and our Commonwealth people, we can trade under World Trade Organisation rules. We can and we will put the ‘Great’ back into Britain, the country of Thatcher, Churchill and the 17.4 million brilliant Brexiteers. Together we will make Britain great again. We don’t need the EU. Let’s go out and make Britain great again in the great wide world. (Mixed reactions)",

However, as the UN Secretary General remarks in his upcoming report, in view of the SDG summit in September, this promise is in peril. Implementation throughout the world, Europe included, is dangerously behind schedule. We have a responsibility towards all these people to deliver, and the European Union should lead these efforts. We should lead by example here at home. And in this regard, the S&D Group reiterates its call to the Commission to present a comprehensive strategy for achieving the 2030 Agenda. The European Union should also be in the driver’s seat when it comes to championing and promoting international cooperation and partnerships as espoused by SDG 17. With Africa, we must develop a mutually beneficial partnership and support them in reaching their objectives. Equally, the ACP—EU partnership is crucial to fostering sustainable development in ACP countries and building stronger alliances to tackle global challenge. Latin America has become even more crucial partner for our union, and we must strengthen our mutual cooperation. Finally, there can be no sustainable development without peace, justice and strong institutions. We can witness this from up close with Russia’s thuggish war in Ukraine.  Dear colleagues, we owe it especially to those already left behind, to be ambitious and we must take bold action.",

However, we need good news and positive examples of development and cooperation. We need to see that you follow our principles and values in practice.

Many among us know of a girl who did not want to stay pregnant or who got pregnant when she didn’t want to become pregnant or who was raped.  Where I come from, I saw girls at school who died because they were pregnant. Not only because they wanted an abortion and didn’t get it and had to do it illegally, but sometimes because their parents kicked him out. I was about 16 when my neighbour killed his daughter because she was pregnant. At school, some girls were sent out because they were pregnant. But who made them pregnant? These people didn’t get any punishment and didn’t take any responsibility.  When I remember the speech by Simone de Beauvoir in the French Parliament, what she was saying was not that abortion should become some kind of pill or condom. She was saying that we cannot abandon women, that we need to understand them, to help them and to have a legal framework to support doctors who can help them, that, as a society, we are responsible together. We cannot let girls die. When I was a teenager, when a girl died because she tried illegal abortion, people would say ‘it was abortion’, like you would say ‘it was malaria’ or ‘it was an accident’. This is what happened.  Today I would say I support legislation to help women have a free and safe abortion. But I have a question. Why does this Parliament always keep quiet when mostly women can’t even decide if they want to have sex with the husband? They are imposed. Please think about that. We all deserve the same rights. ",

On that basis, new administrative structures and practice will eventually be developed, as the Banking Union and the Capital Markets Union beckon. Complex interests are at play – national and transnational, state and private. Subject to such complex pressures, those managing and arbitrating the euro’s regulatory movement must be totally neutral. All States and corporate actors, the general European public, the regulators themselves, must have the assurance that this is the case. That assurance is not available as of now.  Post-employment calculations and expectations can colour the way in which the regulatory process is being developed. Also, post-employment the inside information and know-how obtained when working in regulatory mode can serve to give advantages to one’s new employer, but the revolving door practice is still being tolerated. There is, too, a reverse revolving door issue. We need to understand how conflicts of interest could arise from positions held pre-public employment when nominating people to top regulatory or executive positions. That problem, too, cannot be ignored. We should not tolerate the contamination of the regulatory neutrality that the eurozone requires if it is to develop properly.",

Last week, we received the shocking news of the killing of journalist Shireen Abu Aqla, who was killed by a gunshot when she was reporting on an Israeli military operation taking place in Jenin in the occupied Palestinian territory on 11 May. The External Action Service spokesperson issued a statement on the same day strongly condemning her killing and sending condolences to her family, friends and colleagues. Another journalist, Ali al—Samoudi, was wounded. The EU has called for a thorough and independent investigation clarifying the circumstances that led to her death. It is essential that this investigation clarify all the circumstances of these incidents, and as soon as possible, and that those responsible are brought to justice. It is unacceptable to target journalists while they perform their jobs. Journalists covering conflict situations must be ensured safety and protection at all times. The European Union stands in solidarity with journalists and will continue to support their fundamental work, in particular while covering conflicts. Just days after World Press Freedom Day, the European Union recalls the crucial role played by journalists, media workers and free and independent media. Honourable Members, on Friday last week, 13 May, during the funeral procession of Shireen Abu Aqla, we witnessed scenes that showed disproportionate use of force and disrespectful behaviour against participants of the mourning procession. The High Representative / Vice—President gave a statement on the same day, noting that the European Union is appalled by the events that took place during the funeral procession. The EU condemned this disproportionate use of force and the disrespectful behaviour.

Also, if you look at our current European Semester structure, for example, the Annual Sustainable Growth Survey, which we are publishing today, we are focusing on four dimensions of competitive sustainability.

Last year, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Member States’ requests for assistance under the Union Civil Protection Mechanism went fully or partially unanswered. This painfully demonstrated the need to rethink and improve the response in the context of crises such as the current pandemic: namely, crises which simultaneously affect many or all Member States. We are therefore grateful that, with the strong commitment of the European Parliament, we could reach in a record time of only eight months a political agreement on the Commission’s proposal to strengthen the European Civil Protection Mechanism. With targeted adjustments to the existing legal framework and with the substantial budget increase, we will be better prepared and be more flexible to support Member States in addressing not only the current pandemic, but also any future large-scale crisis. I wish to make three brief points on the key elements of the new legislation. First, we need to invest in the resilience of our societies, and for this it is essential to enhance disaster-risk management and planning, in particular for crises that cross borders and impact different sectors. As a new element of the legislation, the Union disaster resilience goals will provide a strong evidence base to guide our prevention and preparedness measures and thus offer a more strategic approach. Second, we need to be able to support Member States with additional response capacities that in emergency situations could be directly procured by the Commission. This includes additional EU capacities in the field of transport and logistics, which has proven to be a major bottleneck at the outset of the current COVID-19 pandemic. To serve as an additional safety net, the Commission is now also able to step in and directly procure other EU capacities if resources available at national level are not sufficient in times of overwhelming crisis. Third, with the Next Generation European funding, the Union Civil Protection Mechanism will receive a significant budget increase, and budget implementation will become more flexible. This will allow us to continue to grow direct EU medical stockpiles and invest in other capacities to further increase our readiness to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. But the reinforced Union Civil Protection Mechanism also presents us with a great opportunity to strengthen our preparedness for future crises other than COVID-19 by investing in reinforced capacities to deal with forest fires as well as chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear disasters, taking into account lessons learned and shortcomings identified through the current crisis. We will jointly continue to pursue the same main objective: to improve Europe’s resilience by increasing our operational capacity to respond effectively to different types of large crises that I fear are unavoidable also in the future.",

Access to quality and inclusive education, developing civic education modules, as well as youth entrepreneurship and environmental education are key points that we must act upon. At the same time, young people from vulnerable categories should be better supported in order for them to have a decent standard of living and more opportunities in regards to education, skills and labour.

I also thank the Finnish Government for their commitment towards gender equality. This is a subject that is very close to my heart and I am committed to doing everything within my power to eliminate this scourge, this suffering which millions of girls and women are made to endure, even now as we speak. It is essential that we expose and combat this severe violation of human rights, women’s rights and children’s rights.  The EU and the United Nations programme to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, with an investment of EUR 100 million, is the Spotlight Initiative, as was already mentioned. With this project, the scope is to leave no girl, no woman behind. The current EU projects in several African countries and the support the EU gave to the UNICEF programme on abandonment of female genital mutilation (FGM) have reached more than 1.5 million women, who received services for protection and care related to FGM. This programme also galvanised civic movement through the encouragement of more than 3 000 communities, representing 8.5 million individuals, to make a public declaration of abandonment.  We know that FGM exists also within the European Union. Estimates show that at least half a million girls and women who have suffered from genital mutilation live in Europe. The European Institute for Gender Equality plays a leading role in providing information and research on female genital mutilation in the EU. In all our Member States, FGM is a crime. The efforts to combat it and support its victims are also integrated in EU legislation, notably the Victims’ Rights Directive. The issue is covered in EU asylum legislation.  The Commission continues to provide funding through the DAPHNE strand of the EU programmes for projects aimed at combating gender-based violence, including FGM. The next call for proposals will open in early 2020 with an indicative budget of EUR 12.4 million.  Honourable Members, we need to do more to make sure that the predictions of another estimated 200 million FGM victims by 2030 will not materialise. President von der Leyen’s Agenda for Europe has put the prevention of gender-based violence and the protection of victims at the heart of the Union’s equality policy for these five years. I am fully committed to the fight against gender-based violence and I am sure I can count on the support of the European Parliament on this matter.  The forthcoming robust gender equality strategy, which we will adopt in 2020, will address violence against women directly through various measures, including those addressing FGM. It is important to work on different areas at the same time and to tackle the issue from different angles and across the portfolios. I believe we can continue to work on the five priority areas outlined in the 2013 Commission communication on ending female genital mutilation, that is: improving knowledge and data, supporting sustainable social change, protection, prosecution and combating FGM worldwide.  Women’s rights are indeed at the core of EU foreign policy, and this includes the fight against FGM. We need to work with our international partners across the world to support the implementation of the UN sustainable development goals, which cover violence against women. The European Parliament has an important role to play through its political networks around the world. We have to acknowledge that FGM is a sensitive matter to tackle. It encompasses a variety of areas, from general human rights to women’s right to bodily integrity, the tackling of gender-based violence and the right to health. This is why it is important that we work together with FGM survivors, FGM practicing communities and experts in an empowering manner, free of misunderstandings and misconceptions. We must avoid stigmatisation, racism and xenophobia at all costs. We should instead promote empowerment, cooperation and dialogue. Apart from funding and legislation, we must include all stakeholders at all levels, from our political dialogues with national administrations, to our support for health care professionals, religious and community leaders, and families in eradicating female genital mutilation once and for all. I look forward to your views today, and to working with you towards this mandate on this very important issue. ",

But thank you even more for the warmth and the compassion, not only for those who have lost their lives, but also for those who have lost their loved ones; for those who survive the floodings and the droughts and the wildfires and the smoke and the particles and what have you, because they are many. And they are out there looking at us, saying, ‘respect our loss’. Those who are victims of the climate in action, they should be remembered with their respects and the mourning that they all deserve. And their survivors, their siblings, their parents, their friends, their partners – they should see that we have learned from what we haven’t done yet so that we do more both to prepare for the worst, but also to do what we can to prevent. Citizens are a powerful actor of change. The more aware we are, the more we enable people to be part of fighting climate change, the better. A day in commemoration of the victims of the climate crisis, well, that is such a day. And it could indeed also become an international occasion, since it is a day of commemorating the victims of the global climate crisis – not the European victims, but the victims, and I think that is absolutely crucial. This is not about being us – this is about being we. We will keep discussing the legislation, the implementation of the legislation, the investment, the innovation, but I do hope that in this House representing people, that a day to mourn the victims, to care for their loved ones, that such a day we can agree on, because that shows what this is all about. It is about humans. When we live and when we die, that there is someone to remember us.",

        "speech": " – Madam President, a fantastic achievement of the European Union has been the development of a robust consumer law acquis, providing rights to consumers and also empowering them to make the right decisions. EU consumer law should largely be based on the principle that well-informed consumers make the best choices and that they can trust in an effective law enforcement. Commissioner, like my S&D colleagues and many others, I welcome the update of the Consumer Agenda. I would like to highlight two specific issues. First of all, the notions of ‘average consumer’ and ‘vulnerable consumer’ which are used in EU law. I believe that, in the digital world, these notions need to be called into question because the consumer is faced with constant monitoring and manipulation. Consumers are in a state of permanent digital vulnerability, or ‘vulnerability by default’. Therefore, we need a shift away from the average consumer to the principle of ‘protection by default or by design’. This would be a clear and real reaction on the information asymmetries we face. I also believe, like many of us here, that legislation without effective enforcement puts at risk consumers’ trust and confidence in the single market. And here I arrive at my second topic. According to the regulation on air passengers’ rights, passengers should be reimbursed in seven days for cancelled flights. We all know that. Even if we intend to help airlines overcome the extraordinary circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic and protect the employees – there are hundreds and thousands of employees in these companies – this can only happen without harming consumer rights.  I believe that the recommendation of the Commission on reimbursement for cancelled transport services in the context of the pandemic was necessary. However, on my written question, Commissioner Vălean answered that the responsibility of enforcement is linked to the national enforcement bodies and that the Commission considers appropriate actions only in case of a systematic failure. Well, I think there is a clear systematic failure in this case, but we do not see an effective reaction to that by the Commission, so we should avoid such situations. If we want to keep consumers’ trust and confidence in the single market we have to do that. I hope that these examples help to clarify how we can develop our Consumer Agenda beyond 2020. Consumer rights are in the DNA of our socialists and democrats, and together with many colleagues and you, Commissioner, we will advance and protect them.",

But Europe defends its citizens, its freedom and wants to achieve peace with unprecedented means and measures. This was unexpected by Putin’s Russia and this is why we have to underline that Europe is using the European Peace Facility exactly for what it was meant to be used for. And Europe is also fighting back in a bloodless way against the bloody war attack in terms of sanctions. Yes, within Europe the leadership of Serbia is of concern, the leadership of Hungary is of concern, but the alignment and unity are unprecedented and will remain.

Almost three years after that, we see a weaker Europe and more poor Europeans than before. We have millions of Europeans who cannot make it from one month to another due to increase of energy, food and fuel price.

And I quote: ‘Emissions must have a price that changes our behaviour’, Ursula said in this plenary in 2019. We see now that her objective from the beginning was not to combat carbon emissions, but to change our behaviour through higher taxes and higher prices.

        "speech": " Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Madam President, our relations with Turkey, from these three events that the President has mentioned, show that our relations with Russia continue to deteriorate.  These three particular issues that you want us to address today are clear examples of that. First, Russia’s destabilisation policy against Ukraine, despite the ongoing withdrawal of its military from the Ukrainian borders, which is good news, but they were there for a long time with a lot of resources. Second, there are worrying internal developments, particularly in the case of Mr Navalny. Yes, he has stopped his hunger strike, but what has happened has happened. Third, the recent diplomatic crisis after the finding of criminal acts in the Czech Republic carried out by Russian intelligence services, as the Czech Republic’s authorities claim.  So our relations with Russia are once again at a low point. Unfortunately, we cannot rule out that this negative trend will continue and that we will reach even more dangerous levels of deterioration. Without wanting to feed further a dynamic of escalation – nothing is further from my intention, let that by clear – we are nevertheless showing that we will not accept intimidation tactics and that we have to respond to them if they happen. Let’s go first to the Russian military aggression against Ukraine. The recent military build—up in the proximity of the Ukrainian borders – more than 100 000 soldiers – and the illegal annexation of Crimea has severely affected and aggravated the security situation in the region. Last week, we had an in—depth exchange with the European Union Foreign Ministers and the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba, and our message was clear: the Russian actions are completely unacceptable and we firmly support the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders.  Russia must cease its provocation and cooperate in a de—escalation of the tensions instead of portraying itself as a neutral mediator. That’s what Russia is doing now – they don’t have anything to do with the conflict in Ukraine; they are just there to try to mediate in an external problem in which they don’t intervene directly. This pretence must be debunked because, up to now, Russia has shown no willingness to end the conflict on terms that would safeguard Ukrainian sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence. For Russia, the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements is not a key condition. For us, it is. It’s a key condition for a substantial improvement in our relations. For the European Union, an independent and prosperous Ukraine is an indispensable element of European stability and security, and that’s why we want Ukraine to continue the pace of reform, because there is no better way to face Russia than to be a country with a fully democratic system, free of corruption and using our resources, that we are very ready to provide, in order to improve the quality of the governance of the country. Looking ahead, we need to continue to pass coordinated messages of steadfast support for Ukraine. If we participate in the Crimean Platform Summit this August, we should also stand ready to look into options for additional responses should Russia re—escalate or cross a red line.  Second, on the health situation of the Russia opposition politician, Alexei Navalny, there our voice has been very strong and united. We have made an EU statement, on behalf of the 27, calling on the Russian authorities to grant Mr Navalny immediate access to the doctors that he trusts. The Russian authorities are responsible for his safety and health and will be accountable for it. Finally, last week, Mr Navalny was finally taken to a civilian hospital and examined by independent doctors, as we were requiring. Soon afterwards, he called off his hunger strike. We will maintain our strong calls – the same message that I went to Moscow to tell the Russian Minister, eye to eye and face to face – for ensuring the right conditions for Mr Navalny’s speedy recovery, on top of international efforts. As you know, last Wednesday thousands of courageous people took to the streets across Russia to further demand freedom and justice. Instead, in response, the prosecutor’s office asked that Mr Navalny’s anti-corruption network be qualified as an extremist organisation. I certainly expressed our grave concern about this yesterday. I am quite pessimistic. Unfortunately, we cannot expect that things will improve during the next electoral process in Russia in the September Duma elections, which will bring more limitations to fundamental freedoms in the run-up to these elections.  Third, on the involvement of the Russian military intelligence in the explosion at an ammunition depot in the Czech Republic in 2014. It’s true that it’s seven years ago, but even so it happened. The conclusion by the Czech authorities that officers of the Russian military intelligence, the GRU, perpetrated this attack, causing the deaths of two Czech citizens, are extremely serious. The fact that it happened seven years ago doesn’t decrease the gravity of these facts. This is not about military intelligence. This is about a grave criminal offence that runs counter to Russia’s international obligations and such behaviour cannot be accepted. That’s why I have to insist once again on the idea that we have to use the three verbs that I have used: to contain, to engage and to push back. I will go back to this idea after listening to all of you. Let me clearly state our full support and solidarity with the Czech Republic. The asymmetric response by Russia – expelling diplomats and now threatening a limitation in the number of local staff – is being met by a determined response from the European Union and its Member States.  To finish, let me remind you that our policy framework towards Russia, based on the five principles, continues. We will work on internal resilience, fighting against hybrid and cyber threats, strengthening our engagement with our eastern neighbours, including the Russian people, stepping up support to Russian civil society and human rights defenders, and by enhancing people—to—people contact. We will continue to signal to Russia that we are ready to engage in areas of clear interest. This is also true. We have to engage. I said contain, push back and engage, because we need to engage with Russia in areas which are clearly of shared interest. I mentioned the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and I can add climate change. We need to maintain channels of communication with Moscow. I am ready to do so, and we also stand ready to improve relations, if needed and if possible, with the Russian Government if they show a genuine willingness to do so, and certainly with full respect for our values, principles, and interest. To finish, I have to say that, unhappily, I see a worrying trend from the Russian authorities that seems to be choosing deliberately to deepen the confrontation with the West – with us – including through continued attacks of disinformation and other negative activities. We must therefore define a modus vivendi that will avoid permanent confrontation with a neighbour who seems to have decided to act as adversary. I am looking forward to listening to you and to knowing your positions, that I know will be many and varied, and to taking some stock of them in my concluding remarks, because I think that we have to be prepared for a long and hard period in our relations with Russia.  I thank you, Madam President and Members of the European Parliament, for giving me this opportunity. Let’s make good use of it. ",

It’s a different situation today than it was before. Opinion polls are showing that more than 50% of Belarusians want real change and only a minority want Lukashenko to stay. The mood of the people of Belarus reminds me of our Baltic Singing Revolution of the 1990s. Belarusian rock bands are coming out with popular songs against the regime. People of the cultural elite are bravely coming out on YouTube with their anti-regime statements. Bloggers are creating a real online network of resistance. And all of them are persecuted by the regime. Lukashenko’s main competitors, Babaryko and Tikhanovskiy, are in prison. During the last months the list of internationally-recognised political prisoners increased to 30, including famous opposition leaders like Pavel Sieviaryniec. Today we need to send three clear and loud messages. The first to the citizens of Belarus: we are in solidarity with you in your demand for change and we shall defend your right to decide on the change in your country to become a normal a European democratic country. Second, a clear message to Lukashenko and his nomenclatura: if, on 14 July next week, opposition candidates are not registered by the authorities, if political prisoners and candidates are not released from prison, and if the people on the street are threatened and persecuted, there will be sanctions – personal sanctions.

        "speech": " rapporteur. – Mr President, the cultural and creative sector was one of the hardest hit by the COVID pandemic. Due to the closure of venues, exhibition halls, festivals and the cancellation of live performances, the sector experienced losses in turnover of over 30% in the year 2020. Culture is a major economic factor for the EU, representing 4.4% of EU GDP and employing 7.6 million people. But culture is not only about economic terms. It has a substantial social impact contributing to democratic, sustainable, free and inclusive societies and reflecting and strengthening our European diversity, values, history, freedoms and way of life. Culture touches the lives of EU citizens. I am therefore proud to stand here today as the rapporteur to present the report on the situation of artists and the cultural recovery in the EU, with which we support artists and cultural workers throughout the European Union. Due to my personal experience as a former performer, I can confirm that many artists already struggled before COVID-19 happened. For many cultural and creative professionals it was necessary to have a second income in order to guarantee a certain degree of social security and stability. And to the insecurity of income it adds difficulties to combine family life and career due to unstable working hours and rapidly changing work environments. Imagine having all these worries and yet you still need to find enough time to be creative! This is why this report is not only about recovery itself. It is to give greater security to those affected. With this report we, as the European Parliament, call upon the Commission and the Member States to act. We ask for access to unemployment allowance, health care and pensions. And we urge Member States and the Commission to take specific measures to tackle unstable income, unpaid work and job insecurity, and to safeguard a minimum standard of income for artists and cultural professionals.  We also need to avoid bureaucratic burdens such as work permits or permits for holding festivals, and we have to avoid double taxation for cultural workers acting across borders. Especially artists from smaller Member States face problems due to the fact that their domestic market is small and that can hinder their professional growth. We therefore call upon the Member States to establish at least one mobility and information point to offer free and tailored support. Furthermore, we call upon the Commission to define the status of an artist in the EU, to explore possibilities of mutual recognition, and even a European framework for governing the status of artists, to ensure that artists can benefit from their rights derived from that status throughout the entire European Union. But a safety net is not all. Artists often have the talent but they lack the skills to transform their ideas into financial success. Therefore, they should also have access to training in entrepreneurial skills which will help them to transform their creativity into a reliable source of income.  Finally, the sector also faces other problems. While many women work in the sector, very few women are in decision-making positions and discrimination against women persists. LGBTIQ+ and artists from minority groups are more likely to be the targets of attacks or subject to restrictions. In this report we made sure that artists in the EU are better protected against political repression and all forms of discrimination, because the freedom of artistic expression is a core value of the EU and must continue to be guaranteed.  With this report, we have taken a big leap forward and I am proud to continue the work that we have started last year in September with our resolution on the cultural recovery of Europe. I want to thank my fellow rapporteurs for their good cooperation and the strong compromises we have reached, so thank you for that.  I also want to thank my colleagues from the Cultural Creators Friendship Group with which I have tabled several amendments across party lines thus demonstrating that when it comes to the protection of artists, authors and performers, this House stands together as one. And therefore, I hope for your support in the vote.  So to all the artists, authors, performers and cultural professionals: you have the support of the European Parliament so please continue to entertain, amaze and inspire us.",

        "speech": " Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, Minister, I would like, first of all, to thank all of you for your interventions and the good debate today.  The terrible events we have experienced this summer in Europe and worldwide are yet another wake-up call. Natural question: how many of those wake-up calls do we still need? Many of you call today for clear political will, and I couldn’t agree more that it’s high time to prove our political will – our political will to properly implement European legislation that is in place to make our nature more resilient and slow down climate change, but also political will to further step up efforts and show more ambition. Because what the extreme weather events over the last year showed is that climate change and loss of biodiversity are progressing faster and faster. The reply cannot be a lowering of our ambition, but more commitment to increase it.  Some of you were asking whether we are late. Yes, we are. But hopefully not too late if we now urgently speed up and step up, better prepare for and address the climate crisis – and let us be clear, every single region in Europe will be affected by the impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss, even those which so far thought they were more or less safe.  To those who mentioned agriculture today and the need to support our farmers, let me be very clear. Our greener CAP, our biodiversity strategy, our ‘farm to fork’ strategy, they are our straightjacket for our farmers. They are our plan to make them more resilient – more resilient against biodiversity loss, against climate change, including of course natural disasters and their consequences that they are already facing.  Our policy is an insurance policy for the future, for all the sectors, so much dependent on healthy nature. Without a healthy, resilient nature, there will be no food security. This is also what we will discuss with the Czech Presidency at the next Environment Council, when we will prepare our two key international meetings this year: COP27 for climate and COP15 on biodiversity. Sharm el-Sheikh and Montreal will be key opportunities to get the world on-board and to show commitment also at international level and to promote what is a truly smart solution. I am talking here, of course, about nature-based solutions, protecting and restoring wetlands, peatlands, coastal and marine ecosystems, developing urban green spaces and installing green roofs and walls, or promoting sustainably—managed forests and farmland. These smart solutions help mitigate climate change at the same time as reversing biodiversity loss. They all contribute, for example, to better regulate temperatures, to absorb flood overflows and to attenuate the effects of extreme droughts.  It is the EU’s commitment, if a disaster strikes, to respond and to deliver assistance in the spirit of solidarity, both domestically and abroad. Let me join all of those who have paid tribute today to firefighters and all of those who helped and did everything they could to lower the suffering.  But it’s also the EU’s commitment to avoid disaster, to hit hard in the first place and to protect society against suffering and damage. We have the strategic framework and the tools at our disposal. Climate adaptation policy is already mainstreamed in a number of areas. Prevention requires more political attention that it has been given so far. Our legal deadline is to get ahead of climate change, and for this we need to act on science more than ever. We need a more coordinated effort, targeted funding for good adaptation solutions, rigorous and fast implementation at all levels, not only after a summer like this one, but on a continuous basis every day.",

It’s actually the patchwork of national rules that makes it impossible for them to move around.  Parliament was exceptionally united in its two priorities: first, eliminating the patchwork, and, secondly, making the Certificate accessible to all, in particular by making testing free. The Certificate will eliminate some obstacles, but to what degree it will reopen Europe will all depend on the Member States and on their willingness to harmonise their approach and to adopt a common European approach because today they don’t even use the same COVID map. Let’s not forget that. They’re not even applying the same colour code. They’re just flatly refusing, arguing that it’s a matter of subsidiarity and COVID measures are a national competence. Well, I am absolutely sure that citizens who are confronted with sudden quarantine obligations, unexpected additional testing requirements and last—minute travel cancellations will just be very happy to know that at least it is in line with subsidiarity because the patchwork is still here, the spaghetti of rules and regulations. National governments, it is in your hands to make sure that people can travel freely. We have done our bit. Today we are going to vote on the Certificate that is at least going to remove some of the unnecessary obstacles. We have also obtained the additional EUR 100 million to ensure that free testing is available for those who need it most. I would like to thank my colleagues for this very united effort, together with the European Commission, and I wish everybody a very good summer, and everybody else who has to travel. ",

In this way, we will ensure the complementarity of the proposed initiatives with other measures, through early education, awareness raising and combating gender stereotypes, to achieve a zero tolerance to violence approach. Women and children have the right to live free from violence, and they deserve a strong legal framework to protect them.  Ensuring that sufficient protection and support is available can make a real difference for the lives of millions of victims.

I was a regular and repeated critic of Theresa May’s grudging attitude and her slowness in recognising the rights of settled EU nationals. But the system is now up and running and is working far better than the reciprocal systems of any Member State that I can think of among the 27. It’s simply not true that people are denied – there’s no mechanism to deny people status. They can be asked for more proof. But all of these urban myths that we keep hearing – some of which came to me as a constituency MEP, and when I looked into them, they turned out not to be as they first appeared – are serving to unsettle and alarm our friends and neighbours from EU Member States. When I hear my Liberal Democrat colleagues in particular demanding written forms, or physical forms of ID, when they oppose ID cards as a party, and when I hear them criticising the UK Government without a word of criticism for Member States that have failed to reciprocate, I have to wonder what their motives really are.

        "speech": "on behalf of the Renew Group. – Madam President, Mr Commissioner, dear colleagues, the trouble with authoritarian politics is that without pushback, it becomes ever more aggressive and dangerous. The European Union has learned this the hard way with Putin. But it seems to me that we haven’t really learned this lesson when it comes to our own values and rule of law in Europe.  We now have a Member State government that has stifled independent media, captured independent institutions, which is spreading hate against minorities, and where billions of EU money has disappeared into the hands of oligarchs close to the ruling party. We also have a Member State whose government works to dismantle the independent judiciary by targeting judges, by firing them.  Now, all of this takes place in the EU, a democratic community, with EU financial support and despite the many mechanisms and tools that we have in place to protect our values.  Today we are here to discuss Article 7, which if you look at it, is a fairly straightforward procedure with hearings, with recommendations and ultimately sanctions. So on paper, it is a pretty powerful tool. In practice, the Council has made it toothless and quite opaque. Hearings are random and non—transparent, and even today, even after everything that has happened in Hungary, the Council has failed to even agree that this constitutes a serious breach of EU values, despite no unanimity needed for that statement.  Now thankfully, and after much hesitation, the Commission has finally activated the Conditionality Regulation. But even here there is a risk that the scope will be too narrow and that it will fail to address the systemic deficiencies and risks that stem from the absence of checks and balances in the rule of law, which is precisely what this regulation is for.  Colleagues, I remember last time around many of you were saying when we had this debate that the situation is now unprecedented with a full—scale war on our borders. And now here we are four weeks later after the massacres in Bucha, Mariupol and many others, and what strikes me is that I hear many voices, even in this House, saying that while in times of war we should relax our principles and our rules when it comes to defending democracy in Europe.  But I strongly believe that this is precisely the opposite of what is needed. After Putin’s invasion, many have said that we are now locked in a broader, protracted conflict between autocracy and democracy, between Vladimir Putin’s model and our European model, between tyranny and freedom, between brute force and the rule of law. And I agree. I agree that this is this is the conflict that we’re facing, which is precisely why, now more than ever, it’s important to protect our democratic model in Europe, why we cannot relent, why we cannot now relax our rules, because otherwise, how are we going to prevail in this conflict that is upon us?",

        "speech": " Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, thank you for this opportunity to address you today on the increasingly important issues. Everybody is following closely the developments in the Middle East in the past weeks, both in Israel and in the occupied Palestinian territories. First I would like to start by underlying both the European Union’s and my own personal engagement with both parties. I’ve been in contact with both Israeli Foreign Minister Cohen – even this morning – and the Palestinian Prime Minister. We invited the Prime Minister to Brussels, where we had a very good exchange at the last Foreign Affairs Council in January. This has been coupled with public messaging. You have seen a number of my statements – not my statements – the last one was an a statement of 27 Member States. Sometimes people blame me for the statements of the 27 Member States. It’s not me, it’s the 27 Member States. I am representing the Council, and the Council is the 27 Member States. This was issued last Wednesday. And when we face a difficult situation on the ground with increasing violence and extremism I think it’s crucial that the European Union is united and speaks with one voice, not my voice, the voice of the 27, all together. And we managed to reach an agreement of the 27. And this is the first time it happened for many years, that we had the statement of the 27. And I spoke this morning on the phone with the Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen, who was not very happy about this debate. He was concerned. He was asking why the European Parliament is interfering in the internal affairs of Israel. He was once again blaming me. Well, sorry, I am coming to the Parliament. The Parliament calls me to discuss something, and I have to come. Which I did. It’s not me who put this title, ‘Deterioration of democracy in Israel and consequences on the occupied territories’, it’s the political groups, and this Parliament is able to discuss about everything they consider important. And that’s what I try to explain to the Israeli minister in a very friendly way: ‘Look, it’s normal that the parliamentarians are concerned about the growing spiral of violence in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories and the need for all sides to de-escalate the situation’. I mentioned this agreement that we reached with the 27 Member States where, of course, we condemn terrorism; of course we fully recognise Israel’s right to defend itself; and we certainly never draw a comparison between operations by the Israeli military and the actions of terrorists. But we have to call for the proportional use of force. No, we don’t want any kind of funding activities that could encourage incitement. Of course we are a strong believer in the two—state solution. And there is no, we believe, viable alternative to that. And with our international partners, we will continue to work for a peaceful solution to the conflict. And I am using this Parliament to say – and I suppose you agree – that the European Union has to engage on looking for peace in the Middle East, and that the Middle East peace process is something that matters for us, and we are engaged on that. Maybe someone doesn’t like it, but we do it because we believe that is our contribution to the security in the region and to our security too. So I hope that today will be a good discussion to show to Minister Cohen that the Parliament is ready to discuss what is happening in the Middle East and how we can contribute to the peace process. And this is not at all to have an anti-Israeli position. Not at all. Second, we have known Israel for its vibrant democracy. That’s true. So vibrant that we have seen five elections in the past three years. Very vibrant. Five elections in three years is quite a dynamic electoral process. And the new government is keen to pursue a judicial reform. And that’s what we want to discuss today: a judicial reform which has led to a heated internal political debate. And everybody knows, because everybody watches TV and reads newspapers, that many Israelis have been demonstrating in the streets. And both the government and opposition are using fierce language. A compromise seems difficult, but as far as I know, talks are ongoing, especially thanks to the efforts of President Herzog. And I don’t want to prejudge the outcome of this debate. I am not part of this debate. I am just saying that this debate is taking place. And I can’t remember you what the President Herzog himself has said. And we are a close observer because Israel is a key partner. Our values are based on our democratic and open society and the rule of law. And we expect this to continue. And if we have concerns, if you have concerns, you will not hesitate to express them and convey them as you do with any part of the world. For example, the Knesset is discussing a bill that could re-establish the death penalty. We know that we are strongly and we are in principle opposed to the death penalty. And for sure today, I’m sure that many members will engage on this clearly. And third, with full respect to the internal political dynamics in Israel, this Chamber is fully empowered to discuss these dynamics and to understand what happens there with respect to our perception of our values and interest in the region. Nothing is strange on that. This cannot be seen as an interference, but a way of showing our interest and our appreciation for the Israeli democracy. And then you present in the title of the debate also the consequences on the Palestinian territories, the occupied Palestinian territories. And I am not inventing the new world if I say that the situation there is grave. And that violence has reached levels unseen since 2005, with an appalling number of victims, including children. Things cannot go on like this. And I made a call with our statement and also with an article published in the Middle East press, asking both sides to act urgently and responsibly. They need to do whatever they can to allow for a change of course. And we have been clear and I will be clear once again: settlements are illegal under international law. Is that being anti-Israeli saying that? No: settlements are illegal under international law. And the expansion must stop, as well as demolition and evictions of Palestinians from their homes. The Israeli Government must seriously counter the violence of settler extremism and hold perpetrators accountable. And military operations must be proportionate and in line with international humanitarian law. It’s difficult not to agree on that. But the Palestinian Authority must act too. They must redouble their efforts in terms of security cooperation and work to prevent acts of terror that have claimed many Israeli lives. It is equally important that the Palestinians work towards reconciliation in order to reunite the Palestinian territories under one single legitimate authority. Palestinian factions should engage constructively in reconciliation talks. Palestinian people deserve the right to vote in national democratic elections to renew the legitimacy of their leadership. This is important also in view of future peace talks. The international community must act as well to help bring about a renewed perspective for peace. And we need renewed international efforts to help both Israelis and Palestinians to think through their options. And in order to contribute to that, on 13 February I met with the Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Faisal, and with Arab League Secretary—General Aboul Gheit, and we agreed to work together towards a viable solution in order to revive and build on the Arab Peace Initiative, also by adding a European peace contribution to it. And in these efforts we will be working closely with other Arab and international partners. We have also supported the work of the US, including on the recent Aqaba Joint Communiqué. And all parties should now respect the agreements that they reached in Aqaba in good faith. And we must help to create the conditions where it will be advantageous for Israelis and Palestinians to go back to the negotiating table and talk. And nothing will make me more happy than to be able to contribute from the European Union to prepare this process. I’m sure everybody in this Chamber agrees that the European Union should do all we can in order to contribute to a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the Middle East and peace between Israel and Palestine. This and nothing else is what is moving us, and in particular me.",

        "speech": " Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, it’s true: the Moldova Association Agreement is a very ambitious one. It has been in place for the last four years. It’s rooted in democracy, respect for human rights and for the rule of law. These values are at the core of the objective of political association and economic integration of the Republic of Moldova with the European Union. But as you have been emphasising, only tangible significant progress on the Moldovan side, with the full implementation of necessary reforms, will enable progress in addressing long-term challenges with which you are very familiar. These challenges are weak state institutions, persistently high levels of corruption and oligarch structures, a deficient judiciary, an aging population and economic challenges faced by young people, leading to poverty and brain drain through immigration. As an associated country, Moldova remains an important partner within the Eastern Partnership Framework. The presidential elections on 1 November will be a crucial juncture in our partnership, and as the report highlights, these elections will be a test for democracy and the rule of law in the country, thus practices contravening international standards must be absolutely avoided. In previous elections, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) observed vote-buying, misuse of state resources and pressuring voters, among others. That’s quite a lot – vote-buying, misuse of state resources, pressuring voters, among others. In the current COVID-19 context, it is even more important to ensure that all Moldovans are given a free and fair opportunity to vote, following a transparent, inclusive and credible election process, which we will be closely monitoring. We also expect the Moldovan authorities to address the recent actions that risk the hard-won independence of the National Bank of Moldova and the stability of the global banking sector. I agree with your report that the lack of results of the prosecution are unexplainable – not to use another word. Multiple postponements of the ongoing trials of the 2014 one-billion-dollar banking fraud, which means 15% of Moldova’s GDP, are deeply problematic. Clear delivery on that issue is a litmus test for Moldova’s fight against corruption. On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic is having a devastating impact on Moldova. Our solidarity and assistance in response to the pandemic has been strong and the European Union remains the biggest provider of aid. We have mobilised over EUR 100 million in bilateral grant support, focusing on the immediate need for protective equipment, strengthening the healthcare system and supporting socio-economic recovery.  Looking ahead, we will be updating our association agenda. This offers a further opportunity to focus on reform priorities across all sectors, supporting civil society and, in particular, engaging with local actors and strengthening independent media will remain key. We shall also continue the full implementation of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area, supporting small and medium enterprises and advancing the ambitious process of regulatory approximation. Our future assistance will continue to be linked to clear delivery and reforms. The European Union’s strict and smart conditionality phase out as it pushes the necessary reform to improve lives and strengthen Moldova’s resilience. This is the purpose of our association agreement, and I am very happy to participate in this presentation of your report. I fully agree with the need to continue working with Moldova and to fully engage on the fight against coronavirus and these challenges that I have been mentioning which show that this country really needs and deserves our support.",

Still 1 million people in Europe have no access to water and 8 million have no sanitation today. This is cause for grave concern and must be a wake-up call for all decision-makers across Europe. We as politicians have a responsibility to ensure that all people in Europe have access to safe and healthy water to drink, and we must also make sure that the EU’s water legislation contains sufficient environmental standards. Later today, we will finally adopt the final agreement on the Drinking Water Directive after many years of revision. It is a welcome modernisation of this important legislation. We are improving access to water for all, in particular for vulnerable groups in our society, and the new rules also mean that we will use better parameters for assessing the quality of drinking water, with tougher thresholds for a number of chemicals as well as the watch-list for pollutants such as microplastics and pharmaceuticals. We are ensuring that tap water across Europe is safe to drink and taking a welcome step towards realising the human right to water in Europe. EU water legislation needs to be foolproof and protect the health of people and the environment. The Water Framework Directive is especially important in this regard and I welcome the fact that we will vote on this resolution later this week. It is very worrying that Member States are not adhering to the framework directive and are not implementing the rules the way they should. Unless there is a big improvement here, the Union will not reach its the objectives under the framework directive by the deadline of 2027. Half of the water bodies in EU have still not attained good status, and good chemical status has been achieved only for about a third of the surface waters. The solution to this is not to dilute the directive, of course. Europe should not lower its environmental ambitions, especially in the light of the Green Deal and the important role that clean water bodies with healthy ecosystems play for nature, our society and the climate.

I spoke to them about sexual education and consent in the countries they were from and the type of education they had received in school. Not one of them was able to say to me that they had received comprehensive sex education. We have a long way to go across the Union in relation to this. If we in Europe are to ensure gender equality – real equality – where women, girls, men and boys, understand their value, worth and responsibilities, we need to progress sexual education, not hamper it. We must educate our young people. As I know well from Ireland, it is rather a lack of education, as opposed to education, that results in alarming and unexpected consequences. And what consequences they are. Development of healthy relationships is hampered, awareness of what constitutes sexual abuse is stifled, and fundamentally it does a disservice to the youth in Europe by denying them the right of information, a fundamental of our democracy.  As regards the proposal that to teach young people about sexual education would be akin to promoting paedophilia, I say absolute nonsense. In fact, sexual education can heighten young people’s understanding and therefore make them more aware of what constitutes sexual abuse and protect them. To deny young people the opportunity of such an education makes them vulnerable, not just at that moment, but actually throughout their lives.  Fundamentally, this proposal will not, and cannot, achieve its true aim to reduce the numbers of young people engaging in sexual activity. Rather, we must encourage young people to be careful and responsible should they make a choice to do so. The only way to do that is through thorough and comprehensive sexual education. I would urge the Polish government not to progress in this manner and not to proceed in this manner. ",

Yet, this time last year, our delegation of MEPs was barred from travelling to the West Bank and Gaza, where Israel controls almost every facet of Palestinian life.  This is not the behaviour of a country that is ‘open to criticism’. MEPs must be allowed to travel through Israel this month to assess the situation in Palestine.

Scientists warn that we are in the decisive decade for humanity’s possible future on Earth. The right to a healthy environment recognises that protection of the environment must be top of the agenda. Underpinning all other rights, the right to a healthy environment is simply fundamental. A healthy biosphere is vital for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in social and economic areas. I welcome the UN’s recognition of this right but, unless this is replicated in courtrooms across the Union, it will be just more talk and no action.  With the eighth environmental action programme, Parliament has backed my calls for this fundamental right of EU citizens to be defended by the highest EU courts. We must fight for the well-being of our planet and our people. A healthy environment is vital in this fight because this fight, in fact, is for our very survival. ",

This was particularly so in relation to preserving the nuclear agreement, which I agree with, and the result, of course, was a triumph for European diplomacy. The other side of the coin is the human rights record in Iran, which is not pretty – particularly the case of the 2012 Sakharov Prize winner Nasrin Sotoudeh. We have a duty to follow all laureates of this prize and to speak out when they are being persecuted. We did this in the case of Nasrin in 2018, and it is deeply regrettable that we must return to renew our call on the Iranian authorities to release her from her arbitrary detention. Today we call for the unconditional release of Nasrin Sotoudeh with renewed urgency. The people of Iran are struggling to battle the COVID—19 pandemic; prisoners – not just in Iran but around the world – are at an increased risk of infection. Nasrin unfortunately contracted the virus recently while she was granted temporary release. She was ordered to return to prison again against the advice of medical experts. Shameful – because this has the potential to be a fatal decision. I’m also dismayed by the continuously high use of capital punishment in Iran. This is not acceptable under any circumstances. Certainly a journalist should not be executed for expressing their views, and laureates should not be tortured and imprisoned for peacefully working to preserve human rights. I call on Iran to call a halt to this practice immediately. While we focus on the case of Nasrin, we must also think of all the other peaceful campaigners and activists, some of whom worked with her and who are facing a similar plight in Iran. Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh linn Nasrin, agus daoine nach í, a shaoradh agus a thabhairt ar ais dá dteaghlach roimh Nollaig.",

History will be harsh on both the European Union and the United Kingdom if we fail on the ultimate stretch.  My group, the ECR, wants a deal. We have always been very close to the British, in particular the Conservative Party. British Conservatives were co—founders of our group. They offered us professionalism, pragmatism and a sense of humour. In the Conservative Party an understatement is an expression of survival, since your opponent within is never far away – basically behind you! However, that party also produced historic leaders like Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher with the power of strong personalities.  Since the British have left, the European Parliament has become more boring, if I may say, and without Nigel Farage over there in the corner, rather quiet, like a provincial assembly. But Mr Farage has found other topics to play the naughty boy of Britain. Without the British, the right to dissent seems to disappear from this Parliament, unfortunately. There is mounting pressure for la pensée unique. Open debate and conflicting arguments, however, are ways to test ideas against reality. Too many narratives in this Chamber remain in a void of self—complacency, missing the much—needed reality check. Without the British, the European Parliament tends to become a kind of religious congregation mainly convinced of itself.  We have to look for ways to keep these qualities the British have brought to this Parliament in which, ironically, English remains the main language of communication without interpretation.  The Brexit negotiations have also shown cultural differences. The French always have une logique and a big design; the British rather proceed case by case, picking the cases that serve them best, as Mr Barnier may have noticed.  I thank Mr Barnier, Mr Šefčovič and Mr Frost, including their teams, for all the efforts to find common ground from different positions. Madam President, we have to close the deal, but Parliament should not resort to grandstanding. Regarding a possible agreement it’s simply ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Political groups should work on a resolution for debate here in Brussels. The vote could be carried out remotely – a useful practicality we have mastered in this eventful year. Let us establish an EP—UK parliamentary delegation to remain in dialogue and to meet old friends in a new era.",

        "speech": " Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, I want to thank the honourable Members for this debate and for all your opinions and views. For me it is extremely important to hear the opinions of this House because this is the first broad debate about if, and how, to regulate the Internet if I may simplify that. And I take several main messages.  First, what I heard from the vast majority of you is: it’s time to get to work. If we are not ambitious to become the rule-makers we will continue to be the rule-takers, the rules which have been created in Silicon Valley and which are imposed on our territory in the EU. So it’s time to get to work with a sense of urgency and I very much count on the European Parliament and your approach to adopt the legislation which the Commission proposed soon enough. Also because we see a lot of impatience on the side of some Member States who want to go their own way. They want to have their own rules for the Internet and I think that it was quite clear also from this debate that we want to have a pan-European smart solution without any fragmentation by Member States.  The second main message which I got is that we are searching and working on the ideologically-neutral solution that the rules we are going to adopt should not be left or right, and that we will seek the solution which will protect the freedom of speech as the primary principle. So these are the main messages I took from this very important debate.  Coming back to the rule-makers, what we are doing is the continuation of the effort of the EU to be the rule-maker with global effect. We already managed to do that with the GDPR where we said that individual people must have the right to have their identity, their privacy, under control. And now we are coming with a set of, I hope, consistent rules which are also consistent with the GDPR and its philosophy. We are coming with the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act, the European Democracy Action Plan, and by all that we want to prove that the EU has a very healthy instinct when it comes to the risks which we see on the Internet and which can cause big harm to our societies.  What I heard from many of you was that the digital big tech grabbed too much power and too little responsibility. I would add I agree with that. The platforms captured a lot of public space. I sometimes say that they privatised the public space, and this is a public space without any public scrutiny whatsoever. So this is also our task: to demand more transparency and more accountability, because what’s happening online is heavily influencing real life.  I think it was Mr Tudorache who said that there is no difference between online and offline, that it’s one world. I tend to agree with that. On the other hand, it’s quite easy to blame the Internet and platforms for all our troubles. I think that we should really take a lesson from what happened in the US at the beginning of January. The platforms for the transmitters of the messages of the former President Trump who was inciting violence, whipping up the crowd who then invaded the Capitol, and there were victims, there were dead people. So I think this is also a very strong goal on all of us who have influence on public opinion and on the reaction of our society to be more responsible and to be aware that social media can be a weapon, a dangerous weapon in our hands.  I am not calling for self-censoring for politicians. I am calling for more responsibility and awareness of the consequences when we use these social platforms and social media. I would like to recommend that you read Madeleine Albright’s book Fascism: A Warning. She speaks about social media as a weapon when it is used by bad people, when it appears in bad hands.  Let me react to several comments regarding disinformation in the time of COVID. I’m sure you know that the Commission has an agreement with big tech to do more against disinformation. So it’s not true that they have just started now, and I appreciate the recent announcement of Facebook that they want to do more against disinformation relating to vaccination. The agreement is simple. I wanted them to enable more space for information from authorities, from health authorities, from those who are responsible for communication and for providing the people with trustworthy and evidence-based information. For the health sector I think that is a very clear message: if you do not occupy the space it will be occupied by disinformation. The Ministers of Health are aware of that and they do their best. I have to praise them for everything they are doing in this very difficult moment and crisis, and they are doing their best to occupy the space with reliable information. The thing is that the people have to trust the information provided by the health authorities.  The fight against disinformation also contains what we offer or what we propose. It contains fact-checking. Honourable Members, let me do this now. I have to react to Mr Haider who said that the EU has not invested anything into the development and production of vaccination. This is fake news, and I think that if something like that is said, it’s also our obligation to come with the facts and deny that. I also want to react because we speak here about the freedom of speech. I want to react to those who were mentioning the situation in Poland. I think we all have seen the black screens. The black screens are quite telling. I think they are screaming. Today it’s a question of protest of the media in Poland, expressed in a black screen. Tomorrow black screens might become a sad everyday reality. We also need to protect the freedom of speech by supporting independent media, not by suppressing them with additional financial burdens.  This doesn’t apply only to Poland. We have recommended many times to the Member States that they should support also financially media who are also the frontrunners in the COVID crisis, media which were already before the COVID crisis under big financial distress because the business model has changed brutally. The money from advertisers is being shifted to the online sphere which we keep speaking about today, and so we need to guarantee that the media can do their job because they have a very important role in our democratic societies.  So coming back to the law which we are now analysing. I have to say that we always advise the Member States to support media, as I said, but coming to the law, we are aware of the draft law and we need to look into it in more detail. We expect Member States to ensure that their fiscal or other policies will not affect the commitment to ensuring a free independent and diverse media ecosystem. I have to add that about the legislative process, which is ongoing in Poland, that it is important to consult such legislation also with the media sector, and I understand from the recent information from Poland that this is foreseen.  I am sorry, I probably was longer than I wanted to be, but I really wanted to react to many of your very important opinions, which I had to take.",

Secondly, I would like to thank all my colleagues who supported full compliance with our international obligations, and in particular the rapporteur for his good work in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI). I can reassure you that in the Renew Group we are committed to work in the same spirit of compromise, but we insist on bringing the EU into full compliance with the Aarhus Convention and all the advice of the Compliance Committee. The proposals from the ENVI Committee are in line with the long—standing demands of this House for more transparency, better access to justice and respect for the rule of law. They are in line with our international commitments, and also with the EU Treaties and the EU legal order. I encourage the Member States to accept our proposals and the Commission to be an honest broker and not a resistance fighter. By not improving access to review at EU level we risk fostering Eurosceptic sentiments by making a clear statement that the EU institutions do not need to provide the same level of access to justice, and therefore public accountability, that is required of the EU Member States, thereby reinforcing the image that the European Commission is an unelected and unaccountable bureaucracy.  The Commission’s decisions on environmental matters, including on state aid, have to be challengeable before the EU courts if they are not in line with EU legislation – and not only because some international body tells us that, but because our accountability to citizens and our responsibility to prevent environmental damage is there. We are bound by the Aarhus Convention and we cannot say that the findings of the Compliance Committee are good only when they are not critical of the EU. We cannot cherry pick from our international commitments.  I sincerely hope that, in October, we will show the other Members of the Convention that we have used the extra time they gave us in goodwill and did our homework. We cannot afford to repeat the failures of the past.

And throughout that debate I had a fundamental disagreement with many people on the committee, but at the same time, we all are collectively in here trying to address the same issue. And that’s to ensure that animal welfare is brought to the highest priority in the European Union and also within Member States. Let us be under no illusions. There have been catastrophic failures by the European Union and Member States in the enforcement of Regulation (EC) No 1/2005. We saw that recently with the ships the Elbeik and the Karim Allah, for example, in the Mediterranean. So, from that perspective, we do need to ensure that regardless of where these consultations and this report take us, in the meantime we have to ensure that Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 is enforced, is vindicated and that the integrity of animal transport and the welfare of animals in transport is vindicated too, Commissioner. So from that perspective, while we continue our consultations, while you consider your deliberations with regard to new regulations, we have to ensure that animal welfare is kept to the highest priority on everybody’s agenda. So from my perspective, and I say this honestly in this European Parliament, this Parliament should represent everybody. We shouldn’t be exclusively in favour of animal rights and against farmers, or for farmers and against animal rights. We fundamentally have the capacity in this particular Chamber, and the Commission and the Council, to ensure that they can both work in tandem. I am very much in favour of ensuring the highest welfare standards of animals from birth right through to the fork. But at the same time, we can’t make theme parks or adventure parks out of our rural communities. So I honestly believe that if we work collectively, intelligently, base our decisions on science, base our decisions on research and base our decisions on the fact that people in rural communities across the entirety of the European Union provide us every day with food, sustenance, maintaining the population. They rear their families. They live in rural communities, sustain those rural communities. So from that perspective, I urge everybody in this Parliament, wherever the report takes us, wherever deliberations with the Commission and the regulations that will come forward in 2023, ensure in the meantime that we enforce the standards that are there. And when we bring forward new regulations, we bring forward regulations that are based on the realities of what happened both in terms of animal welfare and what happens with regard to farmers and broader rural communities across the entirety of the European Union. It can’t be a one-size-fits-all. It can’t be animal transport and animal rights against farmers and rural communities, or vice versa. We have the intelligence and the capacity, and the Commission is obligated to bring forward regulations that are real, that are sincere, that take into account animal welfare in transport, and also sustaining agriculture, rural communities and farming communities.",

We need strong sanctions on an aggressive power, on Mr Putin. That we need energy security, including a gas Union, purchasing of gas together.  And at the same time, you say the EU should go back to being a Union of fatherlands, a free trade area – some of your supporters have even asked for abolishing this Parliament.

Une fois formellement adoptée et mise en œuvre, la directive relative aux actions représentatives offrira une protection solide aux consommateurs européens. Elle améliorera considérablement la mise en œuvre concrète des règles de protection des consommateurs dans toute l’Europe et pourrait ouvrir la voie à d’autres initiatives visant à améliorer l’accès à la justice dans d’autres domaines. Avec cette directive, nous envoyons un signal clair aux citoyens européens: l’Union européenne protège leurs intérêts et notamment leurs droits en tant que consommateur et l’accès à la justice. The directive creates a procedural mechanism of collective redress. It needs to respect the principle of procedural autonomy of the Member States, and their legal traditions. The objective was to allow the new mechanisms to be integrated as smoothly as possible in their national rules of civil procedure. On the other hand, the directive harmonises key aspects of the procedure ensuring a common denominator across the EU, in terms of both rights and safeguards. About the level of harmonisation, I want to add that with this directive the Commission always had the objective of preserving well-functioning national systems which can have different forms of collective redress. Member States can maintain existing systems and introduce new ones. The directive introduces a specific model of representative actions where qualified entities can seek injunctive and redress measures. Member States that already have representative actions have the choice to transpose this mechanism separately from the existing mechanism or to modify existing mechanisms to match the directive’s requirements.  When modifying existing mechanisms Member States have to introduce the missing elements, especially new elements that relate to cross-border actions. Importantly, the mutual recognition of qualified entities from other Member States should ensure for the purpose of cross-border actions under the conditions listed in the directive that this builds on the model already introduced by the Injunctions Directive.  Other features of the directive concerning, for example, the funding of actions or limitation periods may also require some modifications in Member States. However, the directive is not overly prescriptive. It provides the main elements of a general procedural framework but leaves the details to the national system in order to make the mechanism workable in practice. It is therefore likely that Member States only have to make a minimum of changes to their existing systems, and of course the Commission will assist the Member States throughout the transposition process, notably with dedicated workshops. Je voudrais conclure, Monsieur le Président, en remerciant une nouvelle fois le Parlement européen pour son engagement dans ce dossier et pour le débat que nous avons encore tenu ce matin. Je me réjouis de poursuivre notre excellente coopération dans les dossiers de protection des consommateurs, notamment dans la mise en œuvre du récent Agenda du consommateur, dont nous avons eu l’occasion de débattre hier soir. De plus, comme je l’ai évoqué hier, nous poursuivrons aussi nos actions pour changer le comportement des entreprises à travers l’initiative sur la gouvernance durable que la Commission présentera l’année prochaine.",

Moldovan President Maia Sandu just revealed that the Ukrainian intelligence services intercepted a document clearly showing Russia’s plan for a coup d’état in Moldova. Putin has an apparent goal to forcefully change the legitimate power from Chișinău to an illegitimate one, while also destroying Moldova’s European aspirations. Three days ago, the Moldovan pro-European prime minister stepped down, also creating a turmoil which Russia can potentially use to destabilise our partner to whom we granted candidate status just a few months ago. Madam President, on behalf of the Greens/EFA group, I would thus urge you to issue a statement of support to Moldova on its European path.",

President Ursula von der Leyen presented the important figures candidly. Yes, irregular crossings are up by over 60% in 2022. Tragically, innocent lives continue to be lost. No, not all of these arrivings are in need of protection. Of those not in need of protection, indeed too few are returned. Asylum procedures take too long. That is why we continue to push hard for a common and structural solution and today’s debate showed again that such a solution is necessarily complex. In terms of legislation, we need to complete the new pact on migration and asylum. We need more cooperation between EU Member States and speedier domestic procedures. We need to further strengthen our partnerships with those third countries most concerned, including through visa policy, trade and investment cooperation. As Ursula von der Leyen showed earlier that there is momentum and concrete progress. We have proven to be able to respond to sudden demands through the instrumentalisation of persons by Belarus, the situation in the Western Balkans and the triggering of temporary protection for Ukrainians. Over time we have developed a migration and border management toolbox. We have stronger agencies and we have improved coordination. I am grateful for the clear message of ambition and support heard from the Swedish Council Presidency. All of us are aware that this is a priority for Europeans, independently from which angle they look at the very complex challenges of migration. We owe them to keep building a comprehensive solution which leads us to cover all the different aspects, uphold the law, control borders, save lives and provide opportunities, indeed, for legal migrants and our partner countries.",

When he or she finds out that the big techs hardly pay any taxes, what do you think the reaction will be? So the Council doesn’t just need to discuss how to deal with a pandemic but also how to recover from it.  As Chair of the Subcommittee on Tax Matters (FISC), I am proud that yesterday the first own-initiative FISC report on digital taxation was adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with an overwhelming majority and with a very clear message to the Council. A European digital levy should contribute to the OECD solution, preferably fall on profits and raise substantial revenue – also to pay for the expenditure of the Recovery Fund. It’s up to the Council to let digitalised multinationals pay their fair share and contribute to the recovery after the pandemic, so that not just small-business owners and the other taxpayers will pay the price of the pandemic.

Since 2011, the ethnic conflict with the Rohingya, fuelled by religious and ethnic leaders, has been escalated by the Myanmar military, who are not under the control of the Government. Allegations of crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing have been raised by the UN Secretary-General, and in 2017 I also brought the issue to the executive of Liberal International through an urgency resolution. The cooperation and support of Bangladesh has been welcomed, but I have felt it necessary this week to complain to the Bangladeshi Ambassador about recent restrictions to rights and freedoms at the camp in Cox’s Bazar. I believe that the Rohingya should have full rights to citizenship in Myanmar. It has been their home and country for generations. They can’t possibly be asked to state that they are foreigners. The return of the Rohingya refugees and internally displaced persons in a safe and dignified manner, as citizens of Myanmar, the reconstruction of their villages and the restitution of their land are all imperative.

The second best time is now.  Why should the Caucasus be a land of hostility when it can be a land of prosperity? Imagine all the possibilities. A train running from Baku to Yerevan and beyond, old friends who became enemies becoming friends again, investments flowing freely and fairly and prosperity built on the solid ground of cooperation, not hate.  For this to happen, 120 000 Armenians who endure an inhuman blockade must be allowed to live in peace and without fear of ethnic cleansing. Azerbaijanis who were too forced to flee should be allowed to return to their homes peacefully.  An honest peace deal can never be brokered by Russia. Russia creates chaos only to benefit from it.

We have a problem with the Putin kleptocrat autocracy, not with the Russian people. If we let them down, those who fight for the values we hold sacred, we also allow the undermining of these same values.  What do Sakharov and Memorial teach us? We are reminded of Soviet-era intimidation, oppression and atrocities, and we get confronted with the inspiration they still provide to us today. Arguably, the most important instrument we have is to raise our voice and keep telling their stories, the stories of the countless killed in Russia and abroad, those prosecuted and imprisoned, people who simply stood up for their rights, for the environment, for political freedoms or stood as an opposition candidate. Let me share with you a lesser—known contemporary story to pay tribute to all of them. On 15 July 2021, Andrei Borovikov was convicted to 27 months in prison by the appeals court of Arkhangelsk. Allegedly, he spread pornography by sharing a generally available music clip on his profile on the Russian alternative to Facebook. This, of course, was one of these commonly fabricated charges to be able to convict him. Who was Borovikov? Who is Borovikov? He was allied as a local coordinator to Aleksei Navalny. He has a wife and a newborn son. He’s now detained a thousand kilometres from his home, on purpose, moved there after being convicted to make it very difficult for his family to visit him – to break him. Keep telling their stories, past and present. ",

In 2020, the share of young people living with their parents was over 67% in the EU, and that was before the war. That was before the pandemic and before this crisis. As rents and property and property prices grow, housing as such basically becomes inaccessible to millions of young Europeans, regardless of their social status.  And now, of course, we must think about how to tackle inflation and energy prices, but I would really like to see a long-term solution for affordable housing to ensure that nobody is left behind and that young people have the opportunity that older generations, including my generation, have taken for granted.",

For this reason, like many other colleagues, I welcome the Windsor framework that was announced on 27 February.

Let me congratulate Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. The agreement shows that practical and shared solutions to the challenges in the implementation of the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland can be found. It highlights that joint efforts to find bilateral solutions to mitigate the consequences of Brexit can ensure stability and predictability for people and businesses in Northern Ireland, while at the same time maintaining the integrity of our EU single market. The Windsor framework also reflects the EU’s long-standing commitment to protect the Belfast Good Friday Agreement in all its parts. The timely implementation of the solutions identified in the Windsor framework is key now. As the European Parliament, we will deliver on the legislative procedures as quickly as possible.

Workers with children will receive funds to help them with their parental duties while coping with their unemployment situation. If there is an unemployed mum who is struggling to survive somewhere in Europe that has to matter to us.  We are facing a dramatic crisis in the labour market. Millions of women and men have lost their jobs and it won’t be laws or regulations that will create new jobs and opportunities.

It is, thus, fundamental to design policies that accompany our farmers towards this transition, instead of putting even more pressure on them. Forestry also plays a crucial role in addressing climate change. It has significant potential to reduce emissions, sequester carbon and boost economies in a sustainable manner. With over 40% of the EU’s land area covered by forests, it is clear that the European Green Deal must include an updated post-2020 EU Forest Strategy, to put the legislation in line with renewed climate and biodiversity ambitions. However, as the Commission knows, each Member States has its specificities. During the last plenary debate on the protection of forests, Romanian illegal logging was discussed.

Yesterday, Benjamin Netanyahu – though not officially confirmed – visited Saudi Arabia. In a region that has been suffering from conflict and confrontation for decades, such a dialogue between former antagonists is a good sign, and yes, this region really needs such good signs.  Therefore, one could actually wholeheartedly welcome the Abraham Accords if – and that’s the thing – they would live up to their stated goal to build peace. But – and that is also true, Mr White – recent developments are worrisome. The UAE has advanced a major arms deal with the USA as part of the bargain, as if we needed more weapons in the Middle East. Israel has stepped up its settlement policy against Palestinians and the human rights violations in Bahrain continue rather unnoticed. So a deal that only serves to build alliances against other neighbours or to arm the region even further is neither going to build peace, nor should it be supported by the European Union. But, on the other hand, every step that the UAE, Israel, Bahrain and hopefully many, many others take towards de-escalation and peace should have our full support.  So, very much in line with what you said, Mr Borrell, I think it’s time for a reality check. Let’s take the signatories at their word and use the new regional dynamic and the change in the US administration to initiate a new EU-led initiative to work towards an inclusive Israeli and Palestinian peace deal.

Today, there is no evidence that apps can contain a disease, but there are serious fundamental rights concerns, and therefore the app must be truly voluntary, with no incentives to use them and no discrimination against people not willing to use them or who cannot use them. Entry into a country should not depend on using the app. Freedom of movement is a fundamental right, not a prize for downloading an app.  Apps must only be used for contact tracing with no access for commercial players or law enforcement, and data should be stored in a decentralised way. This is important because, especially in exceptional times, interference with fundamental rights must remain proportionate, necessary and limited in time. Governments now have a chance to show that Europe can lead the way in countering this pandemic without compromising on fundamental rights.  So why is it that only a few Member States fully involved their data protection authorities? What are they afraid of? We can’t accept any ideas to install systems of surveillance via contact tracing apps or by using location data, drones, or by openly debating to discriminate on the basis of so-called immunity passes?  Let’s be honest: there is nothing like a silver bullet. Even a fundamental rights-friendly app can only be an addition to physical distancing, masks and more tests.

Our open strategic autonomy is fundamentally linked to our capacity to take up leading roles in standard setting with like—minded partners. Therefore, I am glad that last week’s first meeting of the Trade and Technology Council produced hopeful results, against all odds. I urge the EU to seize this window of opportunity for deepened bilateral collaboration, for example, to combat distortive trade practices, including in the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO).

We are serious about our joint commitment, under the European consensus on development and sustainable development goals, to work with partners to eliminate all forms of sexual and gender-based violence and discrimination, including harmful practices such as, in particular, female genital mutilation. The EU and its Member States have long demonstrated strong commitment and leadership at multilateral level in promoting the rights of women and girls and gender equality. The Joint EU-UN spotlight initiative to eliminate violence against women and girls is an exemplary case in point, an unprecedented global effort to invest in gender equality and women’s empowerment as a precondition and driver for the achievement of the sustainable development goals. In Africa, the spotlight initiative is addressing sexual and gender-based violence, child marriage, female genital mutilation and their linkages to sexual and reproductive health access. The recent International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD +25) Summit, co-hosted by Denmark, Kenya and the UN Population Fund in Nairobi, was extremely successful. Extensive financial pledges were made from both public and private sources, as well as political commitments, notably a reaffirmation of efforts to achieve zero female genital mutilation by 2030, in line with our commitment under the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. Our achievements and leadership are real, but we must continue pushing until we have lived up to our commitment to achieve the objective of zero harmful practices against women and girls. The UN has named 6 February as the international day of zero tolerance for female genital mutilation, and around that day, the European Commission will take stock, as every year, of EU efforts in this field. We look forward to this report. We would also look with keen interest at the proposal from the Commission to renew the EU’s strategic engagement for gender equality that will be expiring at the end of this month. This should, hopefully, include an EU strategy to end female genital mutilation around the world once and for all. Before concluding, let me recall that, unfortunately, a significant number of women in the EU live with the lifelong consequences of female genital mutilation or are at risk of it. Without dismissing our achievements, therefore, we are aware of the need to do more in Europe with respect to the implementation of national laws, specialised support services, or enhancing multidisciplinary actions with affected communities. But I am convinced that, by continuing to work together, we will be able to secure further achievements in Europe and globally. Thank you very much for this very important discussion.",

Distorted value chains and problems with access to critical raw materials weaken our EU strategic autonomy. We need to defend our global interests as the main exporting superpower, increase our strategic independence and support our industry with the inflow of needed raw materials. For this reason, I urge you to finalise important trade deals with Latin American countries, implement the New Zealand FTA and advance negotiations with Australia and India. Our trade deals need to be supported by revised TSD chapters, with a sanctions mechanism whenever possible. This should go along with the implementation of the Due Diligence Directive to cover international value chains and a working ban on imports of products coming from forced labour.",

Irish people living in Northern Ireland who haven’t sought British citizenship cannot and should not have that citizenship foisted upon them.",

And I would like to reassure Mr Weber and many others who intervened in that regard that we will now work on getting the CO2 standards for a cars regulation as soon as possible and of course the European Parliament will get their say on the legality and politics of the delegated act. I know that my colleague, Frans Timmermans, will intervene on other topics, but I’m sure also that his presence here is just proving that this is exactly how we are going to act in the next weeks and months.  I would like to appreciate also the remarks of Mr Azmani and Mr Lamberts on the importance of the competiton activity of the European economy and the Commission, as many of you referred to, presented the proposals of Net-Zero Industry Act and Critical Raw Material Act just to make sure that we would increase our overall security, our open strategic autonomy, and also making sure that we would avoid over-dependency on critical raw materials and sensitive technologies we need for the future.  We know how costly our over-dependence on Russian fossil fuels has become, but we learned lessons from that experience and as you would see from these proposals, but also by our work on the first ever common purchase of gas, that we want to make sure that we will not repeat that mistake.  And therefore your support and clear call, which was reflected in the European Council conclusions, to spare no efforts to make sure that we will use European economic and political weight, not only to get the adequate volumes of gas we need, but also to push the prices lower, is, for us, our primary objective.  As you know, we are working very much on a tight schedule against the clock but I would like to reassure you that we will open the first ever tender for the common purchase of gas already this May. And we very much appreciate that it was clearly reflected also in the European Council conclusions and it got support from the honourable Members of this House.  I would like also to thank Mr Reuten and Madam Charanzová and many others for all their encouraging statements and interventions regarding how important European support for Ukraine is. And, as you know, we do our utmost to get all necessary supplies to Ukraine as soon as possible so they can defend themselves.  The Secretary General of the UN, Mr Guterres, when he was having an exchange with the European leaders, was highlighting how much he appreciates our solidarity lane proposals through which the Ukrainian grains found the way to where they are needed the most, in the Global South.  And we very much appreciate, as Madam Szydło was referring to, the role of especially bordering countries in this regard: Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria. And we know that this assistance and these efforts have a cost, and we are looking into the ways how we can assist these countries also as much as possible.  To the honourable Member, Mr Rangel, I would like to thank for his support and encouragement for the Windsor framework. I just would like to inform you that just last Friday with my counterpart, the Foreign Secretary of the UK, James Cleverly, we approved all the necessary decisions in the joint committee and we open a new chapter in EU-UK relations. And now I believe we can focus on the future and we can focus on how to use the full potential of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.",

        "speech": " Member of the Commission. – Madam President, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Aguilera, as well as the shadow rapporteurs for this very important report, which the Commission welcomes. Following the Council conclusions of July this year and the opinions of the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of last year, your report rounds up the broad support of the major EU institutions and bodies for the Commission’s strategic guidelines for a sustainable and competitive EU Aquaculture of May 2021. The Commission fully agrees with your report. Aquaculture needs to have the prominent place it deserves as it is a crucial part of the sustainable blue economy, and it contributes to the objectives of the European Green Deal. We have also carefully taken note of the concerns expressed in your report when it comes to the current state of play of aquaculture in Europe. In fact, most of these concerns are actually already addressed in the Commission’s strategic guidelines. I would like to focus on two points that were highlighted in your report, namely access to space for marine aquaculture and administrative procedures. The Commission is now working to establish guiding documents, as both the question of appropriate access and efficient procedures are key enablers for our aquaculture to grow. We agree that further efforts are necessary in both areas, which is why we have prioritised these actions. The Commission is also managing and planning actions in areas you highlighted in your report, such as sustainable feed, animal welfare, and environmental performance, and we propose to use Horizon Europe funding to promote research and innovation for aquaculture. On the topic of funding, I can confirm that the Commission regularly monitors strategic guidelines for sustainable and competitive aquaculture. These are duly considered in national programmes under the European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund. Similarly, we insist that these guidelines are taken into account for the multiannual national strategies for aquaculture. Member States seem to have taken this strategy on board, for both the funding and strategy programmes, which we very much welcome, as it demonstrates our common vision when it comes to aquaculture. We also know that the challenge for fisheries and aquaculture coming from increasing cormorant numbers in some areas of the EU is an important concern highlighted in your report. Let me recall that Member States can implement preventive measures to avoid or limit the damage caused by cormorants, including by using the derogations under the Birds Directive, and actions to address conflicts with cormorants can also be funded by the European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund, and this includes prevention and compensation measures. Taking into account the existing instruments and tools, and that we already allow Member States to take preventive measures, the Commission is currently not planning to change the legal protection regime for cormorants. However, we are certainly ready to further support Member States and stakeholders with the existing EU cormorant platform. Furthermore, the mapping of good practices on the management of predators is part of the future guidance document on environmental performance, which the Commission will develop as part of the implementation of our strategic guidelines. Regarding organic aquaculture, to which you paid special attention in your report, we have encouraged Member States to include an increase in organic aquaculture production in the revision of their national aquaculture strategies and in their programmes under the European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund. This increased support for organic aquaculture by Member States will contribute to meeting the farm to fork strategy targets and, together with the Member States, we are working on identifying specific obstacles to growth of EU organic agriculture, which would also be a response to one of the calls in your report. Finally, I’m confident that our combined efforts and support for sustainable and competitive aquaculture in the EU will help this important economic sector to realise its potential in the years to come, to the benefit of us all.",

        "speech": " membre de la Commission. – Madame la Présidente, Monsieur le Ministre, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, je vous remercie d’abord pour le débat de cet après-midi au sujet de l’affaire Pegasus au cours duquel j’interviens devant vous également au nom de mon collègue, le commissaire Thierry Breton, qui n’a pas pu être présent cet après midi. Plusieurs rapports récents indiquent que certains services nationaux de sécurité ont utilisé le logiciel d’espionnage Pegasus pour accéder directement aux appareils de citoyens, y compris des journalistes et des opposants politiques. Permettez-moi tout d’abord de déclarer que la Commission condamne fermement tout accès illégal aux systèmes ou toute forme d’interception illégale des communications des utilisateurs. En fait, c’est un crime dans toute l’Union grâce à la directive relative aux attaques contre les systèmes d’information. La Commission a déjà souligné la nécessité de mettre en place une stratégie de cyber sécurité solide et une forte protection des droits fondamentaux tels que le droit à la vie privée et la protection des données personnelles, qui sont ses principales priorités. La directive vie privée et communications électroniques («e-privacy») garantit le droit à la vie privée et à la confidentialité des communications électroniques. Cette directive interdit en principe l’interception ou la surveillance des communications sans le consentement des utilisateurs concernés. De plus, la directive protège l’intégrité des équipements terminaux des utilisateurs – ordinateurs portables, téléphones mobiles, etc. Généralement, le consentement de l’utilisateur est requis pour stocker des informations ou pour accéder à des informations déjà stockées sur l’équipement terminal de l’utilisateur, à quelques exceptions qui ne sont pas pertinentes ici. La Cour européenne de justice a confirmé que les États membres ne peuvent restreindre la confidentialité et l’intégrité des communications qu’à des fins strictement limitées et sous réserve des principes de nécessité et de proportionnalité, sur la base des obligations prévues par la loi et soumises à des garanties matérielles et procédurales strictes. Le règlement vie privée et communications électroniques renforcera davantage la confidentialité des communications et la protection de l’intégrité des équipements terminaux des utilisateurs finaux. Entre autres, le règlement renforcera les pouvoirs d’exécution des autorités et augmentera le niveau des amendes. Il est donc essentiel que le Parlement et le Conseil s’accordent très rapidement sur un compromis concernant ce texte législatif très important. In addition, processing of personal data falls, in principle, within the scope of the General Data Protection Regulation and the Data Protection Law Enforcement Directive. If the purpose is the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of criminal offences and the processing is carried out by competent authorities, such as authorities tasked with the criminal investigations, the controllers have just to comply with all the obligations laid down in the GDPR or the Law Enforcement Directive in addition to the e-privacy rules. Data processed by public authorities for national security purposes may fall in certain cases outside the scope of EU data protection laws. In any case, the privacy of communication and the protection of personal data is always subject to strict safeguards under the European Convention on Human Rights and the constitutional laws of the Member States. It is for national authorities to demonstrate that such processing is necessary and proportionate for national security purposes. The national competent authorities are in charge of the enforcement of data protection and privacy rules under the control of the courts. It is precisely because the European Union has adopted data protection rules such as the ePrivacy Directive, the GDPR and the Law Enforcement Directive that the competent authorities can take action against privacy or personal data breaches. The report on the Pegasus breaches, in fact, shows the need for such rules. The Commission is following the matter closely. We understand that the Hungarian Data Protection Authority launched an  ex officio investigation into the Pegasus case on 5 August and that it has the power to investigate matters related to the secret surveillance and processing of classified information. It is expected that the Hungarian Data Protection Authority will release further information once the investigation is concluded. The normal duration of such an investigation is two months, which can, however, be extended in order to give the controllers time to answer information requests. Currently the Commission is taking specific measures to improve the cybersecurity of connected devices, including by way of a delegated act under the Radio Equipment Directive which is expected to be adopted soon. The mix of measures envisaged by the new EU Cybersecurity Strategy, issued in mid-December 2020, will allow operators, especially critical ones, to shore up their cybersecurity defences, with particular attention to securing their supply chain and relying on solutions secured by design. Together with the new EU cybersecurity strategy, on 16 December 2020 we made a proposal for a revised NIS Directive to enhance the cyber-resilience of entities and networks. The NIS II proposal raises the EU common level of ambition on cybersecurity through a wider scope, clearer rules and stronger supervision tools. In addition, the Commission announced in the new strategy that it would explore new horizontal rules to improve the cybersecurity of all connected products and associated services placed on the  internal market. Such rules could include a new duty of care for connected-device manufacturers to address software vulnerabilities, including security updates, and ensuring deletion of sensitive data at the end of life. Moreover, the Directive on attacks against information systems requires all Member States to ensure that the illegal access to information systems and illegal interception are defined as criminal offences in their national criminal law and that high common levels of penalties for these offences are in place as a deterrent effect. Still on cybersecurity, let me come back to what President von der Leyen put forward during the State of the Union speech before this Parliament this morning. She made clear that we should not just be satisfied with addressing the cyber threats but also strive to become a leader in cybersecurity. This is why we need a European cyber defence policy, including legislation on common standards under a new European Cyber Resilience Act. Protecting journalists and media professionals against online threats or illegal surveillance will be part of an upcoming recommendation on the safety of journalists announced under the European Democracy Action Plan, scheduled to be adopted tomorrow. The recommendation will highlight the importance of cooperation between online platforms and organisations with expertise in tackling threats against journalists, as well as the role of national cybersecurity bodies in helping journalists in those kinds of situations. To conclude, as more information is becoming available on the Pegasus case, we continue looking closely into the matter. No illegal access to information or communication systems or any kind of illegal interception to users’ communications or devices is allowed in the European Union. The Union has a robust data protection and privacy acquis, which needs to be respected with the collaboration of all concerned. We count on the close cooperation of all relevant authorities in order to ensure that all fundamental rights are respected. Thank you very much for your attention, but of course I am looking forward to hearing your remarks, observations and interventions.",

Boris would do well to remember that Joe Biden is fiercely proud of his Irish heritage. Now the chickens have come home to roost.

This proposal is designed to modernise the EU’s regulatory framework for batteries in order to secure the sustainability and competitiveness of battery value chains. It would introduce mandatory requirements on sustainability (such as carbon footprint rules, minimum recycled content, performance and durability criteria), safety and labelling for the marketing and putting into service of batteries, and requirements for end-of-life management, having in mind that more than 1.9 million tonnes of waste batteries are generated annually in Europe. I consider to be consistent with January 2020 resolution on EGD, which stressed that the new EU regulatory framework for batteries should cover at least sustainable, ethical and safe sourcing, ecodesign including measures to address recycled content, substitution of hazardous and harmful substances where possible, improved separate collection, reuse, refurbishment, remanufacturing, repurposing and recycling – including higher recycling targets, the recovery of valuable materials, extended producer responsibility, and consumer information.

A greater unity in the EU on foreign matters is essential, because that will lead us to be on equal footing with other global powers. But there are many challenges ahead of us, which you have clearly outlined. Yes, we need more cooperation on security matters, but we also have a real job of work to do in terms of protecting multilateralism. Reforming the international organisation system is key, but for me, above all, sustainable development really has to be part of this strategy – and it is a security issue.  It is also of the utmost importance in terms of global strategy that the EU looks beyond Europe much more in this mandate, especially at China, which is a serious threat to multilateralism and is being more and more aggressive on the global stage in Africa, in the Pacific and elsewhere, as the US is retreating from international organisation. It really is important that we look at this. At the same time, we need to involve, India, Japan, Canada, Australia, much more in our focus, because they are defenders of multilateralism and they share our values.

        "speech": "on behalf of the Renew Group. – Mr President, after 456 days of illegal imprisonment, I am very happy with the news that Olivier Vandecasteele, together with two Austrians in one day and have been freed from their Iranian cells. Unfortunately, their cases are not the only ones. There are dozens of European citizens from many Member States detained by Iran and other regimes, and since 2010, over 66 people with an EU or double nationality have been detained in Iran. A prime example is the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, of which I had the pleasure to meet her husband in 2020. In the case of Vandecasteele, the Belgian Government exchanged him for a convicted Iranian terrorist and in the case of Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the UK Government paid a sum worth hundreds of millions of euros to achieve her release.  This is part of a larger trend that these regimes are implementing, a trend which is called hostage diplomacy. Regimes like Iran use our European citizens as bargaining tools to get these things done. And this is completely unacceptable and unethical. So this House has strongly condemned this phenomenon and called for the immediate release of the detainees, most recently in the European Parliament resolution of January 2023 on the executions and protests in Iran. However, the Member States alone often do not have enough leverage to combat the horrific violations of the rights of EU citizens as they find themselves obliged to pay large sums of money or exchange convicted terrorists for their citizens.  So therefore, I call on the Commission to implement a European strategy to counter hostage diplomacy, including a specialised task force that can effectively respond and coordinate when EU citizens are being held hostage by Iran and other regimes because the consulates and the embassies cannot do it alone. The practice has shown that. So there is a special task force needed with special expertise coordinated among the 27 Member States to respond to hostage diplomacy and the blackmailing, of course, of these EU Member States. So Iran and other regimes using hostage diplomacy can only be stopped through cooperation at EU level and we can only protect our citizens if we work together. We must realise that the impact is for the whole EU and not only one single country. So let us work together and protect our citizens from hostile regimes. ",

That runs counter to our shared interest, also to their own. And it has effects beyond just the economic dimension because it contributes to a creeping crisis of trust.  Of course, I wish you well, Executive Vice-President, with the talks that you have ahead of you, but I will still reserve judgment as to what can effectively be done in the negotiations. So we have to focus on what we can do ourselves. I certainly support the reform of state aid rules. I think we should invest together, as Ernest Urtasun has emphasised, in a smart, fair and WTO-compatible way.

Life has become particularly tough for female scholars and students. Thousands have fled to neighbouring Iran and Pakistan and have applied to organisations that help academics to find posts in other countries. However, fewer than 10% have been successful as visa wait—times continue to be a challenge for many.

I’m tempted to say you’ve moved out of the frying pan into the fire, because neither portfolios are particularly easy. I think it’s interesting that we’re talking today in this Chamber about two things which have yet to see a life, if you like. One is an agreement reached but not yet implemented, the other is a three-word title that we’ve yet to see the details of, and we’re panicking already. I remember way back when Peter Mandelson was the Trade Commissioner in your very seat, and at that time Irish farmers were particularly alarmed about any prospect of a trade agreement, so you know exactly the point I want to make. It would be helpful if you could give us some reassurances as to what impact you think this deal will have on European farmers, whether there will be a reduction in meat production within Europe to satisfy the demands of this trade agreement and whether that is a good or bad arrangement.  This morning we voted on a resolution on how to protect pollinators and indeed restore their status, and one of the things that was dealt with was pesticides, plant protection products and a real push to try and use less, and indeed some colleagues would want to ban everything. I don’t think we can do that when it comes to Mercosur. We have no control, and many times when we’ve debated this I’ve been told there is equivalence. Is it better now in this deal, this idea of equivalence? How can we guarantee that the very strong and, I have to say, fine words you spoke in your speech about the depth of this deal around environmental and other issues – how can we be sure that they will actually be implemented in the Mercosur countries?

For far too long we have been looking at as a theme park for people to visit and to look at from time to time. They are real communities with real people and we now have to accept that we have to do an awful lot more to ensure that the vibrancy of these communities is maintained into the future.  Obviously, agriculture is a critical cornerstone in ensuring rural development and rural communities are sustained, but we have to look beyond that. We have to embrace the digital technologies that are out there now. We have to put in place the infrastructure to ensure that there are quality jobs in rural communities across Europe.  One issue that never ceases to amaze me is that we consistently talk about ensuring that young people stay in rural Ireland or in rural Europe, but at the same time, they simply can’t provide houses in rural communities. They can’t get planning permissions. They can’t build sustainable environments. So we do need to look at the whole of rural communities across Europe to ensure that we have young people, quality jobs, but at the same time that they can actually build a home in those communities and reside there into the future. Otherwise, we will continue to lose young people to our cities, and rural communities will continue to degrade. ",

I don’t know what position you will take but I am sure our roads will cross and we will have a good and effective cooperation. The Eastern Partnership initiative allowed us, the European Union, a very unique opportunity of creating a zone of partnership and security along our external eastern borders. For our partners it is a chance to attain prosperity and stability by adopting European standards. We have learned many lessons over the past ten years, including the one that application of programmes without adjusting them to realities, needs and the aspirations of concerned countries does not work. For the next decade of the Eastern Partnership, we need to be more ambitious and, instead of inventing projects, we should invite our partners to join the ones that we ourselves are implementing in the EU. Our Eastern partners must be given a real partnership, therefore, to be included into our initiatives on climate, digitalisation, artificial intelligence, connectivity, energy and social inclusion programmes and priorities. It is evident that those who put more efforts and present positive results on reforms carried out should be allowed to deepen their aspirations with the European Union. We have several countries which, without EU membership, are participating in our single market. Ukrainian workers are already important contributors to Lithuanian, Polish and other economies, and they deserve to have their labour rights fully guaranteed. It needs to be emphasised once again that democratic criteria, especially adherence to human rights and the rule of law, need to be our ultimate priority.

We frequently refer, and rightly so, to the amount of debt that we have to address and to reduce with the gradual and reasonable and effective path. But never forget that there is another mountain, which is the mountain of investment, if we want to keep our leadership on the green transition and if we want to keep our competitiveness in relation to our global partners or competitors.  Of course, the figures you were mentioning, the 500 and more pro year, will be mostly private investments, it is not thinkable that this is for public investment. But part of this will be because it’s impossible not to be public and we have to guarantee a fiscal space for this.

        "speech": " Member of the Commission. – Mr President, one year ago I addressed this European Parliament plenary to thank you for your support to adoption of the decision to declare 2021 the European Year of Rail. One year later, I’m very happy to be with you again to take stock of what we have achieved and to outline what the year has delivered. As the end of the European Year of Rail is approaching, I can confidently say that there is a strong appetite for rail in Europe. Despite the COVID—19 pandemic, the European Year of Rail has been welcomed with great enthusiasm by the sector and beyond. So far, we have received more than 350 proposals for events and activities. The Connecting Europe Express, a dedicated train that travelled across Europe in September and October, visiting 26 countries in 36 days, has been one of the main highlights of the year. It truly lived up to its name, as it brought together national, regional and local authorities, society at large and the rail sector. It encouraged more than 40 partners from the sector to join forces to set up an unprecedented pan—European rail service, clearly showing that Europe is stronger together. At every one of the more than 200 stops along the journey, we were welcomed with great enthusiasm by national, regional, local authorities, stakeholders and citizens, including some of you. We also collected one or more flags at each of these stops, which means that by the moment we reached our end destination in Paris, we had gathered more than 200 flags. So what a beautiful way to symbolise the unifying power of railways in Europe. However, the Connecting Europe Express also illustrated very well the many obstacles rail still faces and needs to overcome to become the preferred mode of transport. Ideally, the Connecting Europe Express should have been one single train, but the lack of interoperability between some parts of the European network meant that we had to have three different trains to fit the different gauges used in Europe. And this is only one part of the story, as our journey across Europe highlighted many other issues that we still need to address to fully benefit from rail’s sustainability potential. So, my takeaway from the Year of Rail is that we need more and better rail. As to make rail more attractive, we need to make rail more reliable, flexible and cost—effective, which is not possible without further innovation and digitalisation. I’m happy, therefore, that in November, the Council adopted the regulation establishing Europe’s Rail Joint Undertaking, the successor of Shift2Rail. At EU level, the lessons learned from the Connecting Europe Express have already fed into our proposals to boost the rail sector. Yesterday, we presented the action plan to boost passenger rail services. This plan builds on efforts by Member States to make key connections between cities faster, through better managing infrastructure capacity, coordinating timetables, pooling locomotives, coaches and wagons, and improving infrastructure to make new train services possible. Yesterday, in the same package, we also adopted a proposal for the revision of the TEN-T guidelines and the Rail Freight Corridors Regulation. Our proposal aims to ensure a stronger link between good infrastructure and good capacity, creating true European transport corridors for rail. In the TEN-T revision, we also build in stronger coordination of investments and the removal of operational obstacles for both rail freight and passengers. And we will continue focusing on rail in our future works, as we will be preparing the Green Freight package for the end of 2022, in which rail will also play a prominent role. It will be our contribution to make sure that the momentum continues beyond the European Year of Rail. So thank you very much for your attention and your support during this year full of events.",

One of the most fundamental duties of any society is to teach its youth about equality and healthy relationships. Healthy relationships means learning to respect each other and to treat each other with equality and dignity. We all share this duty as parents, educators and legislators – and the EU as well – to empower future generations to learn about themselves, their bodies, their rights and their autonomy.  To deny children’s right to knowledge and inhibit their own bodily autonomy would undermine and seriously restrict their rights. To criminalise the teaching of sexual health and education to under-18s is deeply alarming. It requires that children pay the price for regressive political views, which are not their own, at a cost of their health, well—being and fundamental rights. This bill targets LGBT+ and women’s rights in particular, as it violates Poland’s commitments to international agreements on women’s rights, the Istanbul Convention and CEDAW. The criminal law has no place here. The European Parliament must condemn this bill and renew its effort to protect women, girls and LGBT citizens from the growing backlash against equality, dignity and sexual and reproductive health and rights.

And we have a responsibility to look back and ask: how did it all happen? Well, it happened because the people in power told us over and over things they knew were not true. It happened because a compliant media failed to ask the questions and parroted those lies day after day, beating the drum for a war of aggression dressed up as a battle of democracy against authoritarianism. So now, as another country is torn apart, another region turned into chaos, at this uniquely dangerous phase in world history, we see the same people again baying for blood — not their own of course — seizing the moral high ground, condemning peace as appeasement, bellowing that the only option is escalation.

When the leaders meet next week for the European Council, they will address Europe’s long-term competitiveness. And the message from this Parliament today in the in the morning was very clear: Europe needs to once again focus on its competitiveness. This is this is an issue that is at the heart of the Swedish Presidency. Investing in Europe’s long-term competitiveness is how we create more jobs and build a stronger economy for all. The key to do this is, is to focus on our on our biggest and strongest assets, namely the Single Market and sustainable trade.  Like the European Parliament, the Council is also concerned with the multiple crises that are seriously affecting the economic situation in our continent. Part of the response to this is the Green Deal industrial plan that addresses some of the immediate competitive challenges that our businesses are facing. Together with the soon to be finalised Fit for 55 package, it sends a signal to investors and businesses that the European Union is stepping up to seize the net-zero opportunity. But when designing a policy response to the multiple crisis situation that we are in, we must also consider the view that Europe has been lagging behind its main competitors for quite some time now. In fact, long before COVID, the energy crisis and the war in Ukraine, over the last four decades, our growth rates have been sluggish compared to the United States and many OECD countries. Our productivity is lower than that of the United States and the G7. Europe spends far less than our competitors on R&D, and it makes our economies less competitive. That will be a key issue going forward. Reskilling and upskilling is of great importance. It is a major driver in particular for SMEs and their competitiveness and access to qualified labour. This needs to be addressed and that is what the Swedish Presidency’s priorities on competitiveness are about. It is therefore welcome that the Commission will present a strong strategy on long-term competitiveness later this week – tomorrow.  Clearly, the natural starting point for a comprehensive European approach to competitiveness is the Single Market. For the past three decades, the Single Market has offered Europe’s businesses a large-scale home market to grow and compete globally. It has withstood the test of time and we need the Single Market to continue to deliver over the next 30 years. For this to happen, the Single Market cannot be taken for granted. The anticipated Commission communication on the Single Market at 30 will be important. The ideas put forward in that together with the forthcoming strategy to boost growth and productivity will provide us with a solid basis for how to strengthen our competitiveness in the coming decades. These initiatives will guide leaders’ discussions at the March European Council, where the intention is that a long-term approach to European competitiveness will be anchored.  I have outlined here some fundamental milestones for building the competitive economy of tomorrow to the benefit of all. So let me stress the firm commitment of the Swedish Presidency to move this work forward and and we count on support from the European Parliament to help us in this endeavour. Thank you very much for your attention. I am looking forward to the debate. ",

        "speech": " Member of the Commission. – Mr President, like you, I was terribly shocked by the news on 24 November that almost 15 000 sheep had drowned when the ship transporting them capsized in the Black Sea port of Midia. It is, after all, our responsibility to ensure that animals are safe and protected during transport. Animal welfare must remain an overriding consideration in our work.  The information provided by the Romanian veterinary authorities who approved the vessel for livestock transport and supervised the dispatch of the animals, was that available space requirements set out in the EU law were fully respected; but, of course, this is of little comfort as we reflect on the losses sustained on that day. The transporters clearly failed in their primary responsibility to protect the animals in their charge throughout the journey. This is a requirement specifically set out in EU legislation and which must be respected. They failed to take adequate precautions to prevent this loss and to protect the animals from the pain and the distress that they suffered before they perished.  This is about the ethical values of our Union. The Commission is working with Member States to improve the conditions of animals during transport. In recent years, we have taken action to improve the situation, particularly at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey, a well-known hotspot for animal welfare issues. Since 2017, we have dedicated staff and resources to tackle this particular problem. Although more can, and must, be done, the results are encouraging. By working closely with veterinary authorities in exporting Members States and Turkey, and with the cooperation of NGOs, we have dramatically reduced the number of consignments that cross the borders during hot periods. Last summer there wasn’t a single incident reported at the border linked to the road transport of animals.  This does not mean that all issues have been resolved. It is nonetheless a signal that we are at least on the right track. We need to maintain a constant dialogue with Member States and stakeholders through the network of animal welfare contact points and the animal welfare platform, and we need to ensure that this dialogue leads to concrete results and actions. Actions on sea transport have also been taken. In the last two years we audited official control arrangements for sea transport of livestock in four Member States, including Romania. For these audits, we saw that the situation is quite worrying. Many arrangements seem to fall well below the standards established by EU law. Our auditors found particular shortcomings concerning the approval of vessels by the authorities. I am well aware that the supervision and approval of vessels for animal transport are indeed challenging tasks. Specific and extensive training is needed to adequately perform them – specialised training that differs from that provided to most veterinarians. The recent incident makes it abundantly clear that even ensuring that facilities are suitable to accommodate animals is no guarantee that the vessel itself is seaworthy, or that its crew is properly trained.  There are also currently no arrangements to inform veterinarian authorities of problems detected by inspectors in other EU countries, and this is something that we are actively working on with the European Maritime Safety Agency to allow for better sharing of information regarding livestock vessels. We have also worked with Member States to improve their checks on livestock vessels, and this process has brought out some improvement in the inspection systems for these vessels.  A further initiative that we have taken is to engage with the countries receiving live animals in order to get information on each consignment. This will provide valuable feedback on the conditions of the animals on arrival, and promote continuous improvement, and of course, as is usual, we have issued recommendations following our audits. We will closely monitor how these are addressed by Member States.  This is a matter that I will follow closely and I will raise with ministers on every occasion. They all need to take action to prevent incidents like the one that happened in Romania from happening again, and I can assure you that I will work with the same focus to improve the conditions of animals transported by sea, as we did to improve the conditions of animals transported by road under the previous Commission.  I can also assure you that I will look at animal welfare as an important part of the Farm to Fork Strategy that I will be presenting in spring 2020 as part of the European Green Deal, and this includes a critical look at the existing rules, including animal transport.",

We have a problem with the rule of law and the enforcement of the rule of law. For that reason, we have to have a clear distinction between criminal actions, breaches of institutional rules. That is what we are talking about here: breaches of institutional rules and legal but unethical behaviour. The Qatargate case was a case where four Members were charged with committing criminal acts and, of course, an ethics body would not have prevented that because they intentionally violated criminal law. What we need to do first is our institutional rules need to be enforced. And we have to ask our colleagues in this committee, why don’t you enforce the rules we already have and why don’t you put sanctions on those Members who infringe our own rules?

        "speech": " Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, Minister, thank you all for your interventions. Let me start with the three areas where I think we all agree before addressing some of the specific points raised. First, we all agree that the arrival of the COVID—19 vaccines does not mean that the pandemic is over. I think this is a strong message that should come out of this debate. We also agree on the importance of the three golden principles that we set out some time ago, namely equal access, affordability and safety of vaccines. And finally, we do agree on something that is particularly important these days, that in Europe we do not improvise on safety. Nor do we cut corners on the procedures that we have established, and the European model is that independent regulatory authorities have to do their job and politicians have to base their authorisation on sound, scientific evidence. I think the strong support that all of you have shown through this process says a lot.  Let me now address three specific issues where some of you have raised the need for further explanations from the Commission. Let me start first with the issue of confidentiality. We fully recognise the importance of transparency in this process. Transparency is a guiding principle in all our work in the Commission. It is publicly known with which companies we have been negotiating, what type of vaccines and the process through which we have been doing this together with our Member States, but it should be clear that we are indeed bound by the confidentiality clauses in these contracts. Disclosure of any confidential information at this moment in time could undermine the ongoing negotiations we have with other companies, and, as the European Union, we would need to keep as strong a negotiating position as possible.  We cannot unilaterally decide to disclose confidential information such as information on prices under these contracts unless the companies themselves agree to it, and we are in the middle of negotiations which are still ongoing. However, on many occasions Commissioner Kyriakides has confirmed to you in this House that the Commission is ready within the contractual constraints and according to the rules for transmission of confidential information to the European Parliament to make information from these contracts available to nominated Members of this Parliament with specific arrangements once the sensitive ongoing negotiations are concluded.  Another issue that has been raised by many of you is the issue of TRIPS and intellectual property protections. I want to repeat in this House that we will ensure that intellectual property rights are not an obstacle to the universal access to vaccines, including in developing countries that do not have the means to cope. Mr Lange asked for a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer, but I think my answer is pretty clear – that there is an ongoing discussion now in the WTO on the idea of a waiver of intellectual property rights and protections and there are also important flexibilities so that the relevant trade agreement – TRIPS – could allow us to reach the same objective. But, in any case, I want to assure everybody here that we are ready to continue this discussion so that nothing stands in the way and that more vaccines get to where they’re needed worldwide.  Finally, some of you have raised the issue of campaigns. Of course, we are very sensitive and we shall encourage our Member States to continue with their national plans and public information campaigns on vaccination. We will have our own European campaign, if you like, which will be unveiled in the days to come. We do not compete with our Member States on information, but I think we can provide a useful complement to this process. And to that extent we will not only explain factually the benefits of the vaccines that are put on the market, but we would also like to mobilise important role models, important known Europeans. Some UEFA players have already kindly accepted our invitation to participate in our European campaigns, so stay tuned for that.  The rollout of the vaccines is a challenge of historic dimensions. This is a historic moment, and after all the work we’ve been doing for months, I am convinced that we’ll get it right.",

A target of 55% would mean the EU has given up on any chance of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees.  To avoid climate breakdown, we have to cut world emissions at least in half by 2030, and get to zero by 2050. But this is a global average target. Given their greater responsibility for historic emissions, the better—off nations – like in Europe – must do it a lot faster. Setting a climate neutrality target for 2050 is also a climate change denial. Climate neutrality is not a decarbonising strategy. Why are we continuing to prop up the fossil fuel industry? We need real zero carbon emissions by 2040 and we cannot rely on negative emissions technologies that might never even exist.

        "speech": "rapporteur. – Mr President, dear colleagues, yesterday, during the State of the Union, we listened to President von der Leyen speak about transformation and reform. But the loudest part of yesterday’s speech was the one that we didn’t hear, the one about citizens and democracy. One could say it was more like a State of the European Union bubble. It was a discussion between us, more Brussels people and Strasbourg people. In order to transform the State of the Union we need to bring closer to the Union the citizens. And this is precisely the core objective of this report: to find ways of upgrading our European democracy and bringing the EU closer to its people. Indeed, our European democracy has been described by scholars in many ways, but actually few are positive. When people talk about the EU and its processes, they often think about ‘deficit’, ‘bureaucracy’, ‘impersonal’, ‘elitist’ or ‘something far away’. We even invented nice words to cover, I would say, our weaknesses, such as ‘failing forward’ or ‘sui generis model’. While I’m the first to defend the EU, I’m also the first to point out to its weaknesses, because, yes, the EU is not perfect. The EU’s institutional architecture is not fit for the 21st century, and we must admit that. We still think in terms of unanimity and we allow singular governments to take over the EU agenda for selfish national interests. The system in place is one in which one Member State can decide for 26. Unanimity does not strengthen our weakest members, but it weakens us all. Every day you come to work in this House and we vote on laws, but we cannot initiate them. This is not how a real democracy works. So what we say in this report is that we should make the necessary changes so that the EU becomes a fully fledged democracy on its own account: not a sui generis democracy, not something that falls forward just as a matter of gravity or inertia. To achieve this, we need to put Parliament at the centre of our democracy system. We need to become an authentic, bicameral parliamentary system in which the Council becomes a genuine upper chamber. And very importantly, we must put an end to the practice of the European Council tasking the Commission or even the Parliament to do this or that. The Commission and the Parliament are not the Secretariat of the European Council. On top of that, we must bring freshness in our European democracy. And I would say we need freshness in democracy in general. Because we not we have not refreshed and upgraded our democracy model for more than 150 years. We are no longer in the 1800s. Citizens are not engaged in our democratic life because they feel that their voice is not heard. It’s not me who says that, but it’s almost every Eurobarometer. This is why what we propose is to empower the citizens to actively contribute to the democratic life of the Union. And not only every five years when we have elections, but every year. And for that reason, we propose to create the European Agora, which would empower the citizens to be more active in our democratic life.",

        "speech": " Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members. Last year will be remembered in history for Russia’s brutal war of aggression and our unprecedented unity and solidarity with Ukraine. I will always remember how we welcomed millions of Ukrainian refugees, and how we remain strong and determined and stand by Ukraine to this day and will continue to do so.  But when I went home to Sweden during the break, what did people say? What on earth is going on in Brussels? Instead of solidarity, they talked about suitcases full of cash. When I spoke here in Strasbourg last, in December, I could feel the shock, shame and anger in this room – outrage that the alleged criminal behaviour of so few put at risk all the good work of so many. But I also felt the determination, the conviction and the will to learn, to change, to reform. In December, trust was broken. Now we must pick up the pieces. Now we must rebuild better and stronger than before.  So I welcome the measures announced last week to increase integrity, independence and accountability in the Parliament. That’s a good start. But we must do more. Nothing but the highest standards will do for all institutions. That’s why it’s critical to have uniform, strong rules in place, guarded by a joint ethics body for all to answer to. Vice-President Jourová is in constant contact with Parliament and the Council, and the Commission is ready to put forward a proposal.  We can build on the Interinstitutional Agreement on the transparency register signed two years ago – a major milestone in fostering a common transparency culture. Like all my colleagues, I can only meet businesses and organisations on the transparency register. We are uncompromising in upholding the highest standards of transparency about who tries to influence us. It’s normal for us to meet with civil society, with businesses and other partners. As politicians and leaders, we must always be ready to listen. We must always listen to words, but never ever to favours, gifts, bribes. That is totally unacceptable.  That’s why we protect whistleblowers who report foul play. They are essential for the functioning of our democracy. We protect them with our own internal rules and with our EU laws – the Directive on whistleblower protection – and the EU Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, investigates allegations of wrongdoing. We will be debating one such case tomorrow, triggered by a whistleblower.  The European Public Prosecutor’s Office is proving its value day in, day out, defending the EU budget. It was the EPPO that requested to lift the immunity of two Members of the European Parliament in December, and in its first seven months of operation, the EPPO investigated more than EUR 5 billion in losses to the EU budget.  When we talk about fighting corruption, we must be clear: transparency and accountability will not be enough. Corruption is a serious crime and we must fight it with the full force of law. 60% of criminal organisations are engaged in corruption. Criminals are buying people, buying politicians, buying power. Soon, I will propose a new law to criminalise all forms of corruption, with unified definitions of corruption and harmonised penalties across the European Union. We are shaping the proposal as we speak, and I promise you that we will be as ambitious as we can, as tough as we possibly can, and give police and courts the tools they need to eradicate corruption.  The scandal we are discussing goes beyond criminal corruption. In the media there are disturbing allegations about activities of foreign states, foreign agents. It’s normal for us to talk to foreign politicians, businesspeople, leaders. What’s unacceptable is any malicious interference in our internal affairs, in our democracies. High Representative / Vice-President Josep Borrell raised investigations with counterparts in Qatar and Morocco, making clear that we need thorough investigations. There can be no impunity for corruption.  What cannot wait is the defence of our democracies. Soon the Commission will present a defence of democracy package to bring covert foreign influence and shady funding to light against third country entities, covertly impacting public opinion and undermining democracy. We must now urgently put plans and proposals into action to combat corruption and uphold transparency, accountability and honesty, both in our institution and on our continent.  You can count on me that I will do everything in my power to this end, and so will the entire Commission. And I know that I can count on you. I know that in this struggle we are partners. I know that this scandal affects all of you here in the European Parliament very personally: you are sad, angry, but also determined to act. And I ask you to take inspiration from all we have done in the last three years. We’ve dealt with COVID. We are dealing with this war. We can clearly also deal with corruption and root it out wherever we find it.",

Andzelika Borys has been already 196 days in prison and Andrzej Poczobut, just two days less. Maria Kolesnikova was sentenced to 11 years in prison and Maxim Znak for 10 years in prison.

I am sure they will also manage to see what kind of further initiatives can be taken to try and help the situation move forward and avoid the wars becoming irreversible, if you will allow me to put it this way. There are times when there are issues on which some advancements are possible, and some other issues and some other situations that, in certain particular periods of time or of history, require us – I would say the forces of wisdom and reason in this region, for sure, but I would like to say in the world – to try to avoid that the worst becomes a fait accompli, irreversible. And I have the impression – I have discussed this several times with many in the region – that these times we’re living in are asking us to play that role, in this moment to try and avoid that things go so far, that the positive perspectives for a solution to the conflict are still viable in the future. Let me just comment on one thing that I’ve heard during the debate and that has impressed me a lot, because there is the issue of the settlements itself, there is the work we have been doing and we will continue to do, I’m sure, as European institutions on the Israeli—Palestinian conflict, on the Arab—Israeli conflict – because there are two conflicts in one – but then, even more than that, there’s the role that the European Union has in defending and preserving the international rules—based order. And someone in this Chamber said, and I quote: ‘the settlements are disputed, yes, but illegal, no’.  I have the impression that we are moving into a place – and I hope the European institutions, including this Chamber, don’t move into that place – where it’s international law that is disputed. That is a very dangerous place.  So I hope that, beyond differences and divergences, you will manage not only to advise and ask the Commission and the Council in this respect to help contribute to unblocking the situation in Israel and Palestine, to help implement international law when it comes to the settlement issues, but also that you will always keep in mind, as Members of the European Parliament, that international law is not up for discussion, it is to be respected. And that when you reach the point of discussing whether international law is good or wrong, then you’re already in a place where Europe shouldn’t be.",

So, exactly in line with the outcome of the EU summit last year – you know that we were able to organise that finally – the Great Green Wall Initiative is our long—term, very cross—sectoral and multi—actor undertaking initiative.  Very broad and continued mobilisation of actors for the Great Green Wall is key and, of course, this whole initiative will secure a steady stream of action and financial support towards the Great Green Wall, solidifying its sustainability in the medium to long term. What we aim to do is really to develop local and regional global sustainable value chains originating from the Great Green Wall, and that should be supported along with active involvement and commitment from the private sector.  Tree—based and agro—ecology based value chains are probably the strongest incentive for farmers engagement in sustainable land management. So this is something we are working on with our Member States but also with our partners in that region.  When it comes to waste management and waste legislation, I do not have a silver bullet as to how to solve that problem. But, of course, when it comes to the legislation, we also – through for instance, political dialogue – want to work together with our partner countries in order to improve their legislation. But what I’m against is this kind of imposing attitude that we come there and say that, okay, this is the legislation you have to adopt. This is not the mutually—beneficial equal partnership we are presenting and promoting.  That is why, of course, through this dialogue we can always explain what the existing legislation in the European Union is, what our experience of it is, and then we can offer to be at their disposal to help and keep, for instance, technical assistance and provide some expertise if it is needed. But through dialogue, I think that’s the best way to try to support our partners to develop also, and to improve their legislation. ",

Our strong position in the international market comes from the capacity to provide a broad market with laws as harmonised as possible with around 450 million consumers.  That is why it is particularly important to remove the practice of geo—blocking as soon as possible. We want the same service and the same access to the single market for all Europeans. Limiting access not only limits the market, but also the rights that we Europeans have as consumers. The geo—blocking of services and products offered on the online market must stop and the obstacles, even those coming from cross-border deliveries, must be removed. Open cooperation with all Member States is the only solution to reach the single market that we want and to ensure the rights that all consumers should have, no matter the geographical area they are located in.
